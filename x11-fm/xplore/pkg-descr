Xplore is a powerful and highly configurable Motif file manager with an
Explorer-like user interface. Besides the usual tree and file views, xplore
also has a "shelf", a kind of clipboard inspired by the NeXT file manager, and
a "log" pane for capturing output from launched programs. The builtin
automounter allows you to access special devices in a transparent manner. Files
can be moved and copied using simple mouse operations, and you can execute
type-specific shell commands when a file is opened, used as the target of a
drag and drop operation, or manipulated using popup menus. File types can be
defined in terms of arbitrary filename and MIME type patterns. Full keyboard
navigation is also supported, including an incremental filename search
facility. Last not least, xplore speaks all standard X11 session management
protocols and thus integrates nicely with most popular desktop environments.
