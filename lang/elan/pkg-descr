Elan is an educational programming language for learning and teaching
systematic programming.

It was developed in 1974 by a group at the Technical University of
Berlin as an alternative to BASIC in teaching, and approved for use in
secondary schools in Germany by the "Arbeitskreis Schulsprache". It is
presently in use in a number of schools in Western Germany, Belgium, The
Netherlands and Hungary for informatics teaching in secondary education,
and used at the Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands for
teaching systematic programming to students from various disciplines and
in teacher courses.
