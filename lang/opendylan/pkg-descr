Open Dylan compiles to native code and has a full-featured IDE including an
incremental development mode, browsing of runtime objects, remote debugging,
etc. Open Dylan currently only runs on the x86 platform and the IDE does not
yet run on the Linux version. Open Dylan is in many ways a mature
implementation. If you are new to the language, choose Open Dylan if you can.
