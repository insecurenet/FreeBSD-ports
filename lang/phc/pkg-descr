phc is a framework for static analysis of PHP scripts, PHP source to source
transformations, and ultimately compiling PHP scripts down to native machine
code.

The current release does not yet compile PHP and is therefore not yet useful
for end-users. It is however useful for writing tools that operate on PHP
scripts, such as refactoring tools, aspect weavers, or obfuscators. See the
website to get an idea of what is planned for coming releases of phc.
