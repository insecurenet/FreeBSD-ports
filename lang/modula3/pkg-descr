Modula-3 is a systems programming language that descends from Mesa,
Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+.  It also resembles its cousins Oberon,
Object Pascal, and Euclid.

Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the provision
of explicit interfaces between modules.  It adds objects and classes,
exception handling, garbage collection, lightweight processes (or threads),
and the isolation of unsafe features.

This is the Critical Mass implementation.
