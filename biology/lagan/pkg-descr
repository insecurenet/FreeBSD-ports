The Lagan Tookit is a set of alignment programs for comparative
genomics. The three main components are a pairwise aligner (LAGAN), a
multiple aligner (M-LAGAN), and a glocal aligner (Shuffle-LAGAN). All
three are based on the CHAOS local alignment tool and combine speed
(regions up to several megabases can be aligned in minutes) with high
accuracy. The results of the alignment can be visualized using the VISTA
visualization tool.
