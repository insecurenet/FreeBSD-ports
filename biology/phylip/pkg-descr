PHYLIP (the PHYLogeny Inference Package) is a package of programs for
inferring phylogenies (evolutionary trees). Methods that are available
in the package include parsimony, distance matrix, and likelihood
methods, including bootstrapping and consensus trees. Data types that
can be handled include molecular sequences, gene frequencies,
restriction sites, distance matrices, and 0/1 discrete characters.
