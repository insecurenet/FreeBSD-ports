Title:		CPM

Description:

Cpm lets UNIX users read and write standard cp/m 8" floppy disks and
provides a cp/m like user interface for manipulating cp/m files.

History:

The program has been developed in 1983.  Helge was kind enough to change
the original copyright to a BSD-like one, so i've been able to port the
program to FreeBSD and distribute it freely.

Frequently asked question:
