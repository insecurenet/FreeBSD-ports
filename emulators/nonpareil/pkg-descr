Nonpareil is a high-fidelity simulator for calculators. It currently
supports many HP calculators models introduced between 1972 and
1982. Simulation fidelity is achieved through the use of the actual
microcode of the calculators, thus in most cases the simulation
behavior exactly matches that of the real calculator.
