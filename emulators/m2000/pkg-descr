P2000 Emulator

-  P2000T or P2000M model (P2000M emulation is buggy)
-  Support for 1 ROM cartridge
-  User-definable amount of RAM
-  One tape drive
-  Sound through PC Speaker or SoundBlaster (MS-DOS version), or
   USS(/Lite) /dev/dsp (Linux/SVGALib and Unix/X versions)
-  SAA5050 character rounding emulated in high resolution mode

The tape files should be writable, otherwise the emulator won't load them.
