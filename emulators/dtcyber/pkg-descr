The Desktop CYBER Emulator is a project which successfully brought
back to life the revolutionary design of Control Data Corporation
CYBER mainframes. The software provides a reasonable emulation of
a "typical" CDC CYBER 6600, 7x, 17x based system including common
peripherals such as console, tape and disk drives, card reader,
printer and terminal multiplexer. The emulation runs the following
CDC operating systems: ChippewaOS, SMM, KRONOS 2.1, NOS 1.2, NOS
1.3, NOS 1.4, NOS 2.2 and NOS 2.8.2. It does not support NOS/VE
which requires virtual mode only available in CYBER 180s.
