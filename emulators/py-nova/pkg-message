Please note that this is a development version of nova.
Many features are not available.

Currently nova works on FreeBSD 11 and supports QEMU and Xen.

Common issues:
- Security groups are not implemented
- ARP spoofing, DHCP isolation protection are not implemented
- Nova services work from the root user
- No IPv6 support

QEMU issues:
- Need to enable serialconsole (TCP)
- Need to disable online CPU tracking
- Cannot mount cinder volumes

Xen issues:
- Live snapshots doesn't work
- No support for cinder volume hot-plugging
- XENBUS delay (5 min) when using qemu driver and COW images
- Some linux images cannot be booted

Nova requires procfs to be mounted.
Please add this line to /etc/fstab:
proc                /proc           procfs  rw      0       0

Also devel/libvirt port should be installed with enabled QEMU
backend or qemu tools installed separately.

Directory to keep VM data should be created manually
# su -m nova -c "mkdir /var/lib/nova/instances"

For proper networking enable PF
# sysrc pf_enable="YES"
# sysrc pflog_enable="YES"
# sysrc gateway_enable="YES"

/etc/pf.conf should contain:
rdr-anchor "org.openstack/*"
nat-anchor "org.openstack/*"
anchor "org.openstack/*"

To boot images on Xen please specify glance metadata properties
glance image-update b1216ff6-23ec-4a08-baee-43994760158a \
    --property hypervisor_type=xen \
    --property vm_mode=hvm \
    --property hw_disk_bus=xen
