Generator has been installed.

If you enabled the option SDL_AUDIO and your sound is delayed try setting the
variable "sound_maxfields" and "sound_minfields" in your configuration file
(usually "~/.genrc") to lower values. Like:

# default: 5
sound_minfields = 1

# default: 10
sound_maxfields = 2

To gain more performance set the CPUTYPE variable in "make.conf" as appropiate
(in addition to enabling the build option OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS), then rebuild and
install generator.

NOTE: if you want more features use the port "emulators/generator-cbiere".
