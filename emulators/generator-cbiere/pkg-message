If you are using SDL < 1.2.8 and you only see a black window (with sound), try
the following (you must have xvattr, otherwise install it from ports):

xvattr -a XV_AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY -v 1

If you enabled the option SDL_AUDIO and your sound is delayed try setting the
variable "sound_maxfields" and "sound_minfields" in your configuration file
(usually "~/.genrc") to lower values. Like:

# default: 5
sound_minfields = 1

# default: 10
sound_maxfields = 2

If you want AVI recording set the environment variable "SDL_VIDEO_YUV_HWACCEL"
to "0". This will disable hardware support for YUV overlays, which causes the
smoothing and the green backround when there are no ROMs loaded. But AVIs will
be correctly produced.

To gain more performance set the CPUTYPE variable in "make.conf" as appropiate
(in addition to enabling the build option OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS), then rebuild and
install generator.
