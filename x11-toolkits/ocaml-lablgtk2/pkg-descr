LablGTK2 uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide
a strongly typed, yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface
to GTK+ 2.x.

Objective Caml threads are supported, including for the toplevel,
which allows for interactive use of the library.

Please see ${PREFIX}/share/doc/ocaml/${PORTNAME}/README for further
information.
