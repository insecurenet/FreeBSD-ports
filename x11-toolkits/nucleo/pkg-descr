Nucleo is a toolkit for exploring new uses of video and new human-computer
interaction techniques.  Most of it comes from a previous toolkit named
videoSpace.

Like videoSpace, nucleo is motivated by the desire to focus on the uses of
video, rather than the technologies it requires.  In this perspective, the
toolkit is not focused on performance or reliability issues, but rather on
the ability to support rapid prototyping and incremental development of
video applications.
