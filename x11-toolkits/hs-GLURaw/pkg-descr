GLURaw is a raw Haskell binding for the GLU 1.3 OpenGL utility library.
It is basically a 1:1 mapping of GLU's C API, intended as a basis for a
nicer interface.  OpenGL is the industry's most widely used and
supported 2D and 3D graphics application programming interface (API),
incorporating a broad set of rendering, texture mapping, special
effects, and other powerful visualization functions.
