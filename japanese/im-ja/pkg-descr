im-ja is a Japanese input module for GTK2.

Currently supported input modes are: hiragana, katakana, half-width
katakana, zenkaku, Canna, FreeWnn, and Kanji character recognition
(based on Kanjipad).

Conversion hotkeys, status window, preedit text colors, etc. can be
customized through a GUI. An optional applet is also included for the
gnome-panel which can be used to display and change the input method.
