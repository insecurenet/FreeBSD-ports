Zinnia is a simple, customizable, and portable online hand recognition system
based on Support Vector Machines.  Zinnia simply receives user's pen strokes
as a sequence of coordinate data and outputs n-best characters sorted by SVM
confidence.  For portability's sake, Zinnia does not include any rendering
functionality.  In addition to recognition, Zinnia provides training module
that allows one to create any hand-written recognition systems with low-cost.

This port provides Python interface to the library.
