A simple binary file format for storing arbitrary meta and user data.

A meta archive uses a simple binary file format to store both meta and user
data together in a single file. A mar file may be suitable in situations where
a full-scale database is not. Both the mar library and the accompanying utility
are written in C with the intention of porting to many platforms.
