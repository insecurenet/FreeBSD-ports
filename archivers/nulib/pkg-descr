Nulib is a shell-based NuFX archive utility, based loosely on ARC for the
IBM PC and ar(1) under Unix.  It allows you to perform certain operations
on the same archives used by ShrinkIt, e.g. view archive contents, add to
archive, extract from archive, and delete from archive.  Additionally, it
will list and unpack files from Binary II archives.
