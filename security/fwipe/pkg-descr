Fwipe is a secure file erasing program. fwipe0, which actually erases
your files, is immune to filenames containing spaces, carriage returns,
dashes, or any other special characters. You can use it in place of rm
in cron jobs, together with "find ... -print0". The output of fwipe0 is
specially designed to be parsed easily by machine, so it can be embedded
in other applications which need secure file erasure.
