A generic interface for cryptographic operations (hashes, ciphers,
randomness). Maintainers of hash and cipher implementations are
encouraged to add instances for the classes defined in Crypto.Classes.
Crypto users are similarly encouraged to use the interfaces defined in
the Classes module. Any concepts or functions of general use to more
than one cryptographic algorithm (ex: padding) is within scope of this
package.
