This little utility dumps MSRPC endpoint information from Windows
systems. Similar to the rpcdump program from Microsoft, but does not
need a DCE stack and so runs on Unixes. dcetest can be very useful
once inside a DMZ to fingerprint Windows machines on the network.
dcetest operates over TCP port 135. (Think of it as rpcinfo -p against
Windows)
