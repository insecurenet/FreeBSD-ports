#  IPFilter firewall-delete script, called by "doormand". 
#  This removes the "pass in quick" rules from the firewall
#  that were added by one of the ipf_add scripts.
#
#  Called with five arguments:
#
# $1 : name of the interface (e.g. ne0)
# $2 : source IP; i.e. dotted-decimal address of the 'knock' client
# $3 : source port; when this script is called for the first time
#      to delete a broad firewall rule, this argument will be set
#      to a single "0" (0x30) character.  This means that the source
#      port was not known, and a broad rule allowing any source
#      port was set.
# $4 : destination IP; that is, the IP address of the interface 
#      in argument 1.
# $5 : The port number of the requested service (e.g. 22 for ssh, etc.)
#
#
