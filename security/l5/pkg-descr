After examining Tripwire and deciding that it was *way* overkill for my
own purposes...

...L5 simply walks down Unix or DOS filesystems, sort of like "ls -R" or
"find" would, generating listings of anything it finds there.  It tells
you everything it can about a file's status, and adds on an MD5 hash of
it.  Its output is rather "numeric", but it is a very simple format and
is designed to be post-treated by scripts that call L5...

...Unlike Tripwire itself, this is NOT a complete toolkit -- one is
expected to use it as a small, reliable part of a larger system...
