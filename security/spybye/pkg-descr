SpyBye is a tool to help web masters determine if their web pages
are hosting browser exploits that can infect visiting users with
malware. It functions as an HTTP proxy server and intercepts all
browser requests. SpyBye uses a few simple rules to determine if
embedded links on your web page are harmlesss, unknown or maybe
even dangerous.

SpyBye analyzes all downloads in the background and provides you
with a warning notification whenever it encounters content that
is potentially malicious. At that point, you can click on the link
in the notification and receive a more detailed analysis of the web page.
