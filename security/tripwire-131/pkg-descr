Tripwire is a tool that aids system administrators and
users in monitoring a designated set of files for any changes.
Used with system files on a regular (e.g., daily) basis, Tripwire
can notify system administrators of corrupted or tampered files,
so damage control measures can be taken in a timely manner.

If "TRIPWIRE_FLOPPY" is set to "YES" in the environment or on the
"make" command line, this port will write the tripwire database to
a floppy disk, which should then be write-protected and used as a
reference for future runs.  The diskette should be formatted and
present in the "A" drive before starting the "make install" step.
