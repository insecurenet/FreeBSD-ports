pxytest is a command line utility to test a host for open proxies
that are vulnerable to spammer abuse.  It is written in perl.

Unsecured proxies currently are the most significant conduit of
junk email. This is a particularly vexing problem, because open
proxies, unlike open mail relays, hide the origin of the spam,
making it impossible to trace. This utility tests a host to
see if it is vulnerable to such abuse.
