Shishi is a free implementation of the Kerberos 5 network security system.

The goals of this project are:
    * Full standards compliance.
    * Thread safe library.
    * Internationalization, both for client messages but also for non-ASCII
      username and passwords.
    * Integrate with existing password management systems (/etc/passwd, PAM,
      SASL).
    * Clean room implementation with clear copyright and license.
