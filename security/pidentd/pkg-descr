This is a program that implements the RFC1413 identification server. It
was very much inspired by Dan Bernstein's original 'authd' (but unlike
that program doesn't use 'netstat' to get some of the information) It
uses the kernel information directly.  (And is due to that fact a lot
faster). Dan has now written another version of the 'authd' daemon that
uses his 'kstuff' to read the kernel information. Unlike that daemon,
this will use only normally available kernel access functions (and is due
to that more limited in the different machines it support). Please note
that this daemon used to be called pauthd but has changed name to better
reflect what it does (and to conform to the new RFC).
