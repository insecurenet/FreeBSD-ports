Sguil (pronounced sgweel) is built by network security analysts for network
security analysts. Sguil's main component is an intuitive GUI that provides
access to realtime events, session data, and raw packet captures. Sguil
facilitates the practice of Network Security Monitoring and event driven
analysis. The Sguil client is written in tcl/tk and can be run on any operating
system that supports tcl/tk (including Linux, *BSD, Solaris, MacOS, and Win32).
