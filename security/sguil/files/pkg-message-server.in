Sguil-server
============
If you had existing config files in %%PREFIX%%/etc/%%SERVER_SGUILDIR%%
they were not overwritten. If this is a first time install, you
must copy the sample files to the corresponding conf file and
edit the various config files for your site.  See the INSTALL
doc in %%DOCSDIR%% for details.  If this is an upgrade, replace
your existing conf file with the new one and edit accordingly

The sql scripts for creating database tables were placed in
the %%PREFIX%%/share/%%SERVER_SGUILDIR%%/ directory.  PLEASE
note LOG_DIR is not set by this install.  You MUST create the
correct LOG_DIRS and put a copy of the snort rules you use in
LOG_DIR/rules.

The sguild program was placed in %%PREFIX%%/bin/.

Some contributed scripts were placed in
%%PREFIX%%/share/%%SERVER_SGUILDIR%%/contrib

A startup script, named sguild was installed in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/.  To enable it, edit /etc/rc.conf
per the instructions in the script.

NOTE. You MUST create a directory /var/run/%%SERVER_SGUILDIR%%, and set the ownership
to user guil group sguil
You MUST also create certs.  Here's how to do it;
Create the directory %%SERVER_SGUILDIR%%/certs
Set ownership to sguil user and group.
Create a password-protected CA cert.
openssl req -out CA.pem -new -x509
Create a server certificate/key pair.
openssl genrsa -out sguild.key 1024
Create a certificate request to be signed by the CA.
DO NOT password protect your server key.  If you do, you will be required
to enter the password every time you start the server.
openssl req -key sguild.key -new -out sguild.req
If this is the first time you've created the cert,
Create a serial file so your certs will have incremented serial numbers.
openssl x509 -req -in sguild.req -CA CA.pem -CAAkey privkey.pem -CAcreateserial -out sguild.pem
If you're updating the existing cert
Update the actual certificate for your server.
openssl x509 -req -in sguild.req -CA CA.pem -CAkey privkey.pem -CAserial CA.sr1 -out sguild.pem
Put the certs to the %%SERVER_SGUILDIR%%/certs directory
