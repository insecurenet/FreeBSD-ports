'tsshbatch' is a tool to enable you to issue a command to many servers
without having to log into each one separately.  When writing scripts,
this overcomes the 'ssh' limitation of not being able to specify the
password on the command line.

'tsshbatch' also understands basic 'sudo' syntax and can be used to
access a server, 'sudo' a command, and then exit.

'tsshbatch' thus allows you to write complex, hands-off scripts that
issue commands to many servers without the tedium of manual login and
'sudo' promotion. System administrators, especially, will find this
helpful when working in large server farms.
