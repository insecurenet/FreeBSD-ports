This library implements the RSA encryption and signature algorithms for
arbitrarily-sized ByteStrings. While the implementations work, they are
not necessarily the fastest ones on the planet. Particularly key generation.
The algorithms included are based of RFC 3447, or the Public-Key Cryptography
Standard for RSA, version 2.1 (a.k.a, PKCS#1 v2.1).
