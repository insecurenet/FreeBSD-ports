This is keyprint: a quick hack for printing S/Key keys on a small piece
of paper, twice the size of a credit card for easy storage in a
wallet, card holder, etc.  It produces a PostScript file which can be
printed and then trimmed to size:

idea to print this key set on a network printer.  It might be obvious,
but you never know.
