To store passwords securely, they should be salted, then hashed with a
slow hash function. This library uses PBKDF1-SHA256, and handles all the
details. It uses the cryptohash package for speed; if you need a pure
Haskell library, pwstore-purehaskell has the exact same API, but uses
only pure Haskell. It is about 25 times slower than this package, but
still quite usable.
