Razorback is a framework for an intelligence driven security solution.
It consists of a Dispatcher at the core of the system, surrounded by
Nuggets of varying types.

This nugget checks the VirusTotal API for the MD5 of the submitted file.
If the file is found, the short data of the alert will contain the results
from the JSON response from VirusTotal.
