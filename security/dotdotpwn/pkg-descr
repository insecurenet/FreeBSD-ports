DotDotPwn - The Directory Traversal Fuzzer

It's a very flexible intelligent 
fuzzer to discover traversal directory 
vulnerabilities in software such as HTTP/FTP/TFTP 
servers, Web platforms such as CMSs, 
ERPs, Blogs, etc. 

Also, it has a protocol-independent 
module to send the desired payload to 
the host and port specified. On the 
other hand, it also could be used in 
a scripting way using the STDOUT module.

It's written in perl programming 
language and can be run either under 
*NIX or Windows platforms.
