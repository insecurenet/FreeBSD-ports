Razorback is a framework for an intelligence driven security solution.
It consists of a Dispatcher at the core of the system, surrounded by
Nuggets of varying types.

The scripting nugget uses XML across named pipes to pass registration,
alerting and logging information back to the system.  This allows the
use of any scripting (or even compiled) language that can pass XML out
STDOUT with Razorback.
