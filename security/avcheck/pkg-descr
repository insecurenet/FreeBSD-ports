Avcheck is a simple program that allows you to call an antivirus
software in order to check mail messages for viruses before actual
delivery from within a Mail Transfer Agent, or MTA.

Avcheck itself isn't a virusscanner, nor it is an MTA. It sits between
the MTA and a real antivirus software. Most MTAs available today can
call an external program for every mail message in order to perform
various tasks, including virus scanning and content filtering. Avcheck
can be used as that external program.

Avcheck will receive a mail message from a mail system, pass it to an
antivirus software, and, depending on the presence of a virus in that
message, will either allow the message to be delivered or take
appropriate actions to handle infected mail.

Avcheck does nothing with a mail message contents -- it's task is to
prepare file with a mail message and feed it to an antivirus
progra. It's an antivirus task to decode MIME structure, handle
embedded archives and so on. Many but not all antivirus products today
have this ability.
