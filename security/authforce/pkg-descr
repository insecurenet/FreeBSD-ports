Authforce is an HTTP authentication brute forcer. Using various methods,
it attempts brute force username and password pairs for a site. It has
the ability to try common username and passwords, username derivations,
and common username/password pairs. It is used to both test the security
of your site and to prove the insecurity of HTTP authentication based on
the fact that users just don't pick good passwords.
