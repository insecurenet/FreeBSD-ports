This module implements the twofish cipher in a less braindamaged (read:
slow and ugly) way than the existing "Crypt::Twofish" module.

Although it is "Crypt::CBC" compliant you usually gain nothing by using
that module (except generality), since "Crypt::Twofish2" can work in
either ECB or CBC mode.
