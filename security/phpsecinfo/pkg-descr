### WHAT IS PHPSECINFO?
PHPSecInfo is a PHP environment security auditing tool modeled after the
phpsecinfo() function.  From a single function call, PHPSecInfo runs a
series of tests on your PHP environment to identify potential security
issues and offer suggestions.  It can be useful as part of a multilayered
security approach.


#### WHAT IS PHPSECINFO NOT?
* It is not a replacement for secure coding practices
* It does not audit PHP code
* It is not comprehensive test for either your hosting environment
  or your web application
* It is not the "final word."  PHPSecInfo identifies *potential* problems
  and offers suggestions for improvement.  Your environment may _require_
  certain settings that trigger cautions or warnings.
