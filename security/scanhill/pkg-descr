Scanhill is a Microsoft Messenger Protocol Sniffer. Currently it can only
intercept Instant Text Messaging. Optionally, intercepted text messages can be
stored onto an RDMBS (Only mySQL is supported for now). Given that mySQL is
used, stored instant messages can be read through a browser interface that is
written in PHP language. Please see the INSTALL.txt file for instructions on
how to install, configure and run EnderUNIX scanhill.
