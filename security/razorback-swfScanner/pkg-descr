Razorback is a framework for an intelligence driven security solution.
It consists of a Dispatcher at the core of the system, surrounded by
Nuggets of varying types.

SWF Nugget is a Razorback Detection Nugget that scans Flash files
collected by Razorback Collector Nuggets. SWF Nugget decompresses
(as necessary) and parses Flash files to detect attacks exploiting
known vulnerabilities.

The scan results are sent back to Razorback Dispatcher to correlate
with other Razorback Nuggets.
