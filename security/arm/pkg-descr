The anonymizing relay monitor (arm) is a terminal status monitor for Tor,
intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone with a tty
terminal. This works much like top does for system usage, providing real time
statistics for:

  * bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage
  * relay's current configuration
  * logged events
  * connection details (ip, hostname, fingerprint, and consensus data)
  * ... etc
