httprint is a web server fingerprinting tool. It relies on web server
characteristics to accurately identify web servers, despite the fact that they
may have been obfuscated by changing the server banner strings, or by plug-ins
such as mod_security or servermask. httprint can also be used to detect web
enabled devices which do not have a server banner string, such as wireless
access points, routers, switches, cable modems, etc. httprint uses text
signature strings and it is very easy to add signatures to the signature
database.
