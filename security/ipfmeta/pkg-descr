ipfmeta is used to simplify the maintenance of your IPfilter ruleset.
It does this through the use of 'objects'. A matching object gets
replaced by its values at runtime. This is similar to what a macro
processor like m4 does.

ipfmeta is specifically geared towards IPfilter. It is line oriented:
if an object has multiple values, the line with the object is
duplicated and substituted for each value. It is also recursive: an
object may have another object as a value.
