Fast AES cipher implementation with advanced mode of operations. The modes
of operations available are ECB (Electronic code book), CBC (Cipher block
chaining), CTR (Counter), XTS (XEX with ciphertext stealing), GCM (Galois
Counter Mode). The AES implementation uses AES-NI when available (on x86
and x86-64 architecture), but fallback gracefully to a software C
implementation. The software implementation uses S-Boxes, which might
suffer for cache timing issues. However do notes that most other known
software implementations, including very popular one (openssl, gnutls)
also uses same implementation. If it matters for your case, you should
make sure you have AES-NI available, or you'll need to use a different
implementation.
