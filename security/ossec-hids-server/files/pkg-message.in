After installation, you need to edit the ossec.conf file to reflect
the correct settings for your environment.  All the files related
to %%PORTNAME%% have been installed in %%PREFIX%%/%%PORTNAME%% and
its subdirectories.

For information on proper configuration, see http://www.ossec.net/.

To enable the startup script, add ossechids_enable="YES" to
/etc/rc.conf.  To enable database output, execute:

%%PREFIX%%/%%PORTNAME%%/bin/ossec-control enable database

Then check this documentation:

http://www.ossec.net/doc/manual/output/database-output.html

When you deinstall this port after starting the daemons once, many
directories that are created by the daemons will remain.  To fully
remove the port you need to delete those directories manually.  To
further enhance the security on your system, you may also enable
some checks in PAM for a fast reaction against intrusions.
