ADMsnmp is an snmpd audit scanner.
ADMsnmp can brute force the snmp community name (with a wordfile) or
make a wordfile list derived the hostname.
ADMsnmp can report to you all valid community
names found and inform you if writable access to the MIB has been attained.

ADMsnmp is very easy to use and designed with speed in mind!
