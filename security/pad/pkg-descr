This is a small command-line utility for encryption and decryption
using the principle of one-time pads (OTPs).  One or more data files
given to pad are XORd with each other and with RNG output, resulting
in two or more output files.  The output files are indistinguishable
from random noise, except that when the pad utility is used to XOR
them together again, the original data files may be recovered.
