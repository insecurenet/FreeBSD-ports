This project is aimed at installing (and keeping update) the site specific
config files we want, after preprocessing them (conditional content and include
files and include sections). It also triggers postinstall scripts whenever their
associated config file has been changed. It can also remove config files,
including running an preremove script before doing so. All this is driven by an
simple config file list.
