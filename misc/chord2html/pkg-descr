chord2html is a small Perl script to convert CHORD input files (the .chopro
files in OLGA) to HTML. The HTML files are similar to the PostScript documents
produced by CHORD; chord2html reads a text file containing the lyrics and
chords of a song to produce a page with chord names above the words and a
graphical representation of the chords at the end of the songs.
