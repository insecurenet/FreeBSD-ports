Tempcontrol is a temperature control program.  In its current version
it is specifically designed to control the temperature of beer
fermenters in a fridge.  It controls the temperatures when necessary
by turning on either the fridge motor to cool the surroundings, or a
light bulb to warm them.

The specific brewing-related details are relatively minor, and future
versions may become more general-purpose.

Read the file README in the distribution for more information.  At a
later date there will be real documentation.
