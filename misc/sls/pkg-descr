     Sls is a program designed to overcome the limitations of the
     standard  UNIX  ls(1)  program,  providing a more consistent
     interface to file inode  information.   It  is  particularly
     designed for use by shell scripts to make obtaining informa-
     tion about files easier.   It  uses  printf(3)-style  format
     strings  to  control the sorting and output of file informa-
     tion.
