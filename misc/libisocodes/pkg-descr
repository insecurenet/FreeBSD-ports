This library can be used to easily access XML data of the iso-codes
package. It will provide an abstraction layer to handle both the
version 3 and the upcoming version 4 of iso-codes. Moreover, all
available translations can be used as well.

This library makes use of the GObject introspection features, so that
it is accessible from a variety of programming languages, for example
C, Vala, Ruby, Python, Perl, Lua, JavaScript, PHP and many more.
