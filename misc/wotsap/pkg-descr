Find paths between two keys in the OpenPGP Web of Trust, and get statistics
about a key or the whole web.

Observe:
    * We only search the largest strongly connected set.
    * No attempt is made to verify the signatures. For you to be able to trust
      a path, you must verify all signatures yourself.
    * Even if there exists a path between you and another key, you have to
      trust the other people in at least one path in the graph to trust the key.

Keys can be specified as normal key IDs (0x12345678 or 12345678), or a number
of space-separated case-insensitive search terms (i.e. "rms@gnu.org" or
"@gnu Stallman").
