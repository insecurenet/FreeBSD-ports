QLandkarte GT is the ultimate outdoor aficionado's tool. It supports GPS maps in
GeoTiff format as well as Garmin's img vector map format. Additional it is the
PC side front end to QLandkarte M, a moving map application for mobile devices.
And it fills the gap Garmin leaves in refusing to support Linux. QLandkarte GT
is the proof that writing portable applications for Unix, Windows and OSX is
feasible with a minimum of overhead. No excuses!

QLandkarte GT does replace the original QLandkarte with a much more flexible
architecture. It's not limited to a map format or device. Thus if you think your
Magellan GPS or other should be supported, join the team.

Additionally it is a front end to the GDAL tools, to make georeferencing scanned
maps feasible for the normal user. Compared to similar tools like QGis, it's
target users are more on the consumer side than on the scientific one.
QLandkarte GT might not let you select every possible feature of the GDAL tools,
but it will simplify their use to the demands of most users.
