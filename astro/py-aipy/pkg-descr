py-aipy collects together tools for radio astronomical
interferometry. In addition to pure-python phasing,
calibration, imaging, and deconvolution code, this package
includes interfaces to MIRIAD (a Fortran interferometry
package) and HEALPix (a package for representing spherical
data sets), and some math/fitting routines from SciPy.
