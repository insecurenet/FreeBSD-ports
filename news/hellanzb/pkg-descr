hellanzb is an easy to use app designed to retrieve nzb files and fully process
them. The goal being to make getting files from Usenet as hands-free as
possible. Once fully installed, all that's required is moving an nzb file to the
queue directory. The rest: downloading, par-checking, un-raring, etc. is done
automatically by hellanzb.
