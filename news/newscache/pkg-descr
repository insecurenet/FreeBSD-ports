What is NewsCache?

NewsCache is a free cache server for USENET News available under the GNU
General Public License. NewsCache can be plugged in between your news
reader(s) and your news server. NewsCache acts to news readers like a news
server and retrieves news articles from the news server like a news
reader. Whenever, a client requests an article from NewsCache, NewsCache
checks whether the article has already been stored in the cache area. If
this is the case, the article is sent directly to its client. Otherwise,
the article is requested from the upstream news server, stored in the
cache area and sent back to the client.
