ATP allows you to read and compose mail packets of the QWK format,
commonly used on PC-based BBS systems.  With this program, you can
download all of your new e-mail and board messages as a QWK packet,
read them offline, compose replies to selected messages off-line,
then upload all of your replies as one QWK reply packet the next
time you call the BBS.
