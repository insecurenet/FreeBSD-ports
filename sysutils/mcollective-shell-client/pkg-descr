The shell client allows you to get commands executed via MCollective's
mcollective-shell-agent plugin.

It allows the running of long-running processes with a mechanism to check in
on the output from these long-running processes, which is independent of the
mcollective daemon process (the daemon can be restarted without interrupting
the processes)
