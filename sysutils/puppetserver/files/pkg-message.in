Remember to add puppetserver_enable="YES" to rc.conf.

A note to users upgrading to 2.6 who have also modified bootstrap.cfg, please
see the release notes for breaking changes in 2.5.

https://docs.puppet.com/puppetserver/latest/release_notes.html#puppet-server-25

The file bootstrap.cfg has been removed and ca configuration has been moved out
to its own file in ca.cfg.
