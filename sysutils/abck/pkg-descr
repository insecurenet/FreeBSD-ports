'abck' is an interactive tool to examine intrusion attempts and decide
what, if anything, to do about them.  It reads through
/var/log/messages looking for evidence of an intrusion attempt. Upon
finding such a record, 'abck' qualifies it against information
supplied by the user on the command line to determine if the record is
to be processed.  As packaged, 'abck' handles several common types of
intrusion attempt records, but it can easily be expanded to handle
others.

You need a reasonably current copy of Python to run the main script.
