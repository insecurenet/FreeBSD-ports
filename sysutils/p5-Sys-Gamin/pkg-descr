Perl interface to Gamin (File Access Monitor implementation)
Provides a somewhat higher-level and friendlier interface to the Gamin File
Access Monitor API. This allows one to monitor both local and remote
(NFS-mounted) files and directories for common filesystem events. To do so, you
must register "monitors" on specified pathnames and wait for events to arrive
pertaining to them.
