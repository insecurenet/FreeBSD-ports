geomWatch is a program for monitoring the well-being of GEOM providers and ZFS
pools. It checks the state of each configured provider and pool at a configured
interval, and, if it notices that a component has been lost, or encounters a
problem during the check, it will send an e-mail with details of the matter--
such as what components were lost and which remain, or, in the event of a
problem, what the problem was--to an arbitrary number of recipients, so that
corrective action can be taken (for example, replacing a failed disk).
