cdls is a curses-based file manager for quickly browsing directories and
files. The screen can be dynamically adjusted to include all information
(like 'ls -ail'), or just the filenames (multi-column), or anything in
between.

All basic file and directory manipulations are possible with 1 keystroke:
copy, move, delete, view, execute, change owner/group/mode, edit, diff,
link (hard/symbolic), wc, tail -f, cksum, hexdump and many others.
Documentation is self-contained in cdls and consists of two screens from
which each option or subject can be selected to show its info screen.
