qchroot is a csh script for simplified administration of chroots on a
host system. This is a viable alternate to jail(8) when jail(8) is too
restrictive. This runs on RELEASE-9.3 and all newer RELEASES.

The chroot filesystem shares a single copy of the system binaries which
is mounted nullfs "read only" to the named chroot container filesystem.
This provides 2 levels of security protection which is better than chroot
by its self.
