pam_mount is a Pluggable Authentication Module that can mount volumes for a
user session.
This module is aimed at environments with central file servers that a user
wishes to mount on login and unmount on logout, such as (semi-)diskless
stations where many users can logon and where statically mounting the entire
/home from a server is a security risk, or listing all possible volumes in
/etc/fstab is not feasible.
