will check the current swapusage and if more than SWAP_HIGH percent of swapspace is in use it will create a new swapfile with a size of size of SWAP_STEP percent of the current swapspace and activate it.
If less than SWAP_LOW percent of swapspace is in use it will deactivate a previously added swapspace file and remove it.

If called with
.Ar start
it will fork into the background and run as a daemon. It will check and then sleep for DELAY seconds before checking again. Messages about the operation will be piped to LOGGER. The pid of the daemon will be written to PIDFILE.
.Pp                      \" Inserts a space
If called with
.Ar stop
it stop a previously forked swapmon daemon.
.Pp                      \" Inserts a space
If called with
.Ar -F
it will run as a daemon but not detach from the terminal. Messages will still be piped to LOGGGER and not to the terminal by default. You may specify "/bin/cat" as LOGGER to get the messages on the terminal.

swapmon can be called via cron(5). In that case you would receive messages about the swapspace being adjusted via e-mail. To use it that way add a crontab entry to the root crontab similar to this:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed 
.It * *  * * *  /usr/local/sbin/swapmon
.El                      \" Ends the list
