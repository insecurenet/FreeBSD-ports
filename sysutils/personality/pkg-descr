This script provides functionality for manipulating collections of
configuration files which can be organised so as to alter the
personality of a system.

Initially, the "base" personality is established.  This personality
contains the "reference" copies of configuration files, and is used
when creating new personalities.  The files which are currently
considered part of the system's personality are those contained in
the base personality.

A new personality is established by making a copy of the base
personality under a new name.  Each personality maintains a separate
copy of all configuration files under /etc/personality.

To install a new personality, the files currently in place are
saved back to the current personality as indicated in
/etc/personality/current, and the files for the new personality
copied into place.  The 'select' and 'menu' commands which perform
these installations are implemented in such a fashion as to only
require the tools available on the root filesystem, so that they
may be invoked at the earliest stage during system startup.
