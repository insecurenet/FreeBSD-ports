reed is a text pager for reading large files, such as full books
(usually etexts from Project Gutenberg).  It has the features one
would expect for a pager (multiple buffers, searching, file
information, subshells, etc) and more: persistent bookmarks, auto
scrolling, and support for many different types of files.
