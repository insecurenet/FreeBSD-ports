This port allows one to monitor other standalone services and
automatically restart them if they are accidentally and unwittingly
terminated, or crash either because of instability or a DoS attack.
It simplifies a task capable of being performed by cron(8) by not
requiring custom scripts to be written for each service being
monitored. The configuration file is simple and easily setup.

Note: version 0.4.1 has a different configuration file format and
any previous configuration file should be updated accordingly.
