Isomd5sum is a collection of utilities for implanting and checking MD5
checksums within an ISO9660 image. A checksum is implanted in an image
using the implantisomd5 utility, and the corresponding checkisomd5 utility
can be used to verify burned CDs are error-free. Also included is a Python
extension for performing these tasks.
