Terminal ScreenSaver (or tss for short) is an attempt to clone and enhance
FreeBSD's text-mode screen saver. Although intended for GNU/Linux, it works
fine under FreeBSD and probably a lot of other Unix-based operating systems.
Unlike the daemonsaver in FreeBSD, you may choose ASCII art of your own liking
or make your own.
