The etcupdate utility is a tool for managing updates to files that are
not updated as part of `make installworld' such as files in /etc.  It
manages updates by doing a three-way merge of changes made to these files
against the local versions.  It is also designed to minimize the amount
of user intervention with the goal of simplifying upgrades for clusters
of machines.

The primary difference from mergemaster is that etcupdate requires less
manual work.  The primary difference from etcmerge is that etcupdate
updates files in-place similar to mergemaster rather than building a
separate /etc tree.
