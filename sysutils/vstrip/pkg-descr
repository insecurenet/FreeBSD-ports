[ excerpt from developer's www site with modifications ]

vStrip is a VOB de-multiplexing tool, splitter and some other
functions that work on VOB/IFO files.

vStrip is a small command-line utility for stripping (=removing)
unwanted streams (=data packets) out of VOBs (Video Objects) without
having to reweave the VOB, or extracting the data contained inside
a single stream.

It also parses IFO-files so it (hopefully) doesn't get confused by
multi-angle VOBs.
