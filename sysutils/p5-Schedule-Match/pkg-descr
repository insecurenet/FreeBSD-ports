This library allows you to manage schedule which has structure similar
to crontab(5) format. It offers methods to detect clash between
schedules (with or without duration considered), and can also tell when,
and how often they clash.

From the viewpoint of data structure, one major difference compared to
crontab(5) is a concept of duration. Each schedule has its own duration,
and clash detection can be done upon that.
