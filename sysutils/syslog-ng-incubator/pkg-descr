The syslog-ng module incubator (Incubator henceforth) is a collection of
tools and modules for syslog-ng that for one reason or the other, are not
part of the official repository. This serves both as a staging ground for
experimental modules, and as a repository of plugins that are not aimed at
upstream inclusion. It's also an example of a third party syslog-ng module.

The official home page of syslog-ng-incubator is:
