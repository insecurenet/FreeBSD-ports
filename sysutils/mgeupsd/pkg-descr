mgeupsd is a daemon process that sits in the background and check
state of the UPS every 10 (by default) seconds.  As soon as mgeupsd
senses that the power is failing it notifies init(8) and init will
execute the powerwait and powerfail entries. If mgeupsd senses that
the power has been restored, it notifies init again and init will exe-
cute the powerokwait entries. If mgeupsd senses that the UPS batteries
has less than 20% of its energy it notifies init again and init will
execute the powerfailnow entries.
