WebJob downloads a program or script from a remote WebJob server
over HTTP/HTTPS and executes it in one unified operation. Any output
produced by the program/script is packaged up and sent to a remote,
possibly different, WebJob server. WebJob is useful because it
provides a mechanism for running known good programs on damaged or
potentially compromised systems. This makes it ideal for remote
diagnostics, incident response, and evidence collection. WebJob
also provides a framework that is conducive to centralized management.
Therefore, it can support and help automate a large number of common
administrative tasks and host-based monitoring scenarios such as
periodic system checks, file updates, integrity monitoring,
patch/package management, and so on.
