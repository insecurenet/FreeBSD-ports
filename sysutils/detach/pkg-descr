The detach command is a grungy little program for executing programs
in the background, without use of a control terminal. (In the style
of most common daemon processes...) The intent was to create a
program one could start via rsh, to initiate xterm sessions, without
keeping extra local rsh & remote rshd and shell processes alive.
