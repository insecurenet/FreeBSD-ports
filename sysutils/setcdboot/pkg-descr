`setcdboot' is used on the DEC Alpha platform to mark a file bootable
within an Alpha ISO-9660 image bootable.  First create an ISO-9660 image
using `mkisofs', and then run

	setcdboot <name_of_iso_image> <boot_path_within_image>

Once a bootable file image has been marked with `setcdboot', burn the image
to CDROM media in the usual manner.  To boot the resulting CDROM, simply
specify the CDROM device as the boot device and the Alpha will boot as if
from hard disk.
