This is /usr/bin/more from FreeBSD before the import of the less(1) pager.
It is an older version of less that includes some enhancements and fixes
not in less.  These enhancments include support for global(1) tags,
nicer horizontal scrolling, support for portable keyboard configurations
using termcap(5), and a much shorter manpage.

Due to the debatability of the latter feature (is it an enhancement or
a bug?), /usr/bin/more has been replaced.  This port is available for
those who desire any of the above features.
