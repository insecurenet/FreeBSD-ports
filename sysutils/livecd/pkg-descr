The FreeBSD LiveCD Tool Set main goal is allowing one to generate
custom FreeBSD Live CDs. FreeBSD LiveCD was born as a Brazilian
FreeBSD User Group (www.fugspbr.org) project. The objective was to
create a tool that would allow us a safe diagnostic method under
emergency enviroments and specially as a rescue disk where FreeBSD
partitions could only be accessed (mounted) externally.
What is LiveCD? Its such a simple answer, it is nothing but a set
of patches applied to the FreeBSD Initialization files allowing the
system to run from a CDROM, setting the best way to either mount
under Memory File System (MFS) or Virtual Nodes (vnodes) those
filesystems that need Write and Read access. Slices that just need
Read access are still run from the CD.
Can I use it to install FreeBSD? Yes, with recent revision 1.2, it
can install a FreeBSD system without any other disks. It also support
batch operation mode for automated installation processes.
Is LiveCD any different from an ordinarily installed FreeBSD system?
It is a completely functional FreeBSD system just like any ordinarily
installed one. You will be able to both run any applications and
mount any filesystems as any FreeBSD system would allow you.
