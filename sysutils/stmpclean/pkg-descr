The utility stmpclean securely deletes old files from directories
such as /tmp and /var/tmp.

Combining find and rm (possibly with xargs) for this purpose allows
a local attacker to delete any file on the system.  It is a security
hole.

Using one of the nifty floating around Perl scripts for this purpose
is dangerous: when you have an attack they have a tendency to behave
like forking bombs, making matters much worse.
