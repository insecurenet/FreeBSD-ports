This command turns the static output from one or more Unix
commands into a dynamic, pageable, real-time display.  You
specify the command(s) and the delay period between screen
refreshes and Paint Changed Characters does the rest, including
optimizations to minimize cursor movement and the number of
transmitted characters.
