worldtools consists of 3 simple scripts:

- whereintheworld displays the great lines behind the build logs of a
buildworld. It shows at which step the build is at, and which module
is currently being built.

- buildit runs a command, time(1)s it, logs the output and optionally
sends a notification to the user by email when finished.

- upgrade is a wrapper for buildit, whereintheworld, cvsup and make
buildworld. It is a convenient series of shell commands that will
upgrade your FreeBSD system.

See the README file for more details.
