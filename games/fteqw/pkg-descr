The intentions to the FTE QuakeWorld mod are to add some cool features to
QuakeWorld, without loosing any (backwards) compatibility.

All QuakeWorld clients should be able to connect to an FTE server, and all
FTE clients should connect to any other QW server.

The FTE client supports Quake, NetQuake, QuakeWorld, Quake II, Quake III
Arena, Hexen 2, Nexuiz, and others.
