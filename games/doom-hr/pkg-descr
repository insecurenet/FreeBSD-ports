Hell Revealed is a megawad, a 32-level replacement for DooM II, created by
Yonatan Donner and Haggay Niv.

In Hell Revealed, you will find: 32 new high-quality very detailed levels,
many new graphics including textures, flats, skies, status bars and others,
full skill-level support and additional attention to coop-players, and extreme
challenge.

Hell Revealed supports single player, cooperative (with additional weapons and
enemies) and several maps have special DM parts (maps 1 and 2 are especially
good for deathmatch).

The new musics are currently taken from Rise of the Triad - we might release
an updated version with original musics soon.
