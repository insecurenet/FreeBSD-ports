Bygfoot is a football (a.k.a. soccer) management game. Bygfoot allows you to
manage a team by training the players, buying and selling them, contracting
loans, maintaining the stadium, etc. You can be promoted or relegated, even
become a champion. It includes a "team editor" which you can use to create your
own teams or edit the existing ones. The game is deliberately kept simple
(though not easy): you only have to keep one eye at your players and another
at your stadium.
