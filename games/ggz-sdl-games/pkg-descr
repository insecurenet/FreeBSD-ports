The GGZ Gaming Zone - SDL Game Modules
======================================

GGZ does not only feature Gtk+ and KDE games, but also
games written with the SDL toolkit.
The following games are included so far:

        - TicTacToe 3D
                An OpenGL client compatible to our other TicTacToe clients,
                and working fine with our server.
        - The Geek Game
                Calculate numbers, in either direction: horizontally or
                vertically, forwards or backwards, and wrapped around the edges.
