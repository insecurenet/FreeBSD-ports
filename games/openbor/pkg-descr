OpenBOR is the open source continuation of Beats of Rage, a Streets of
Rage tribute game originally developed by Senile Team. In the years
since it has grown into arguably the single most powerful two
dimensional sprite-based engine in the world and certainly the most
versatile. While intended to allow creation of side scrolling beat 'em
ups like Double Dragon or Final Fight, the engine is also capable of
replicating shoot 'em ups, RPGs, platformers and the like. A built-in
scripting engine allows authors to take it even further, making
imagination the only real limit.
