Was the first visible part of The Python Game Book project.
TuxFighter is a little Asteroids-like Shooter game, written around 2006.
The game support modding. You control Tux, the penguin (with mouse or keyboard)
and shoot down rectangular enemies (to make points).
Shots may reflect from the screen border, and self-shooting result
in negative points.

In the game, you can pick up one of those power-up's and enjoy
different effects.
