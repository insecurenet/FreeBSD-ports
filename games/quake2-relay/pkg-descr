Have you ever wanted more from a Quake2 demo?  Tired of making every
player record demos of your clan matches just to see everything?  Now
your problems are over (well not all, but..).  With Quake2 Relay, you
can record entire matches and play them back through the Replay
module.  Unlike client demos, which only record a match through one
player's view, relay demos can record everything in the level for the
entire duration of the match.  With Replay, you can watch these matches
through any player's perspective, chase-cam mode, or free-fly mode.

Benefits of Quake2 Relay:

  - Every player's perspective is recorded
  - No lag
  - Smaller and easier than many separate demos
  - Many different viewing options
