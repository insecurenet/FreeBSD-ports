Bombz is a simple 2D puzzle game. It doesn't really have a plot. The object is
to blow up all the bombs on each level then escape off the edge of the screen.
To blow up a bomb, push it to where you want to cause an explosion, then collect
a match (originally a detonator in the Archimedes version) and touch the bomb
again and quickly get out of the way. A bomb destroys everything surrounding it
except the metallic walls; if it blows up another bomb, that takes out
everything around it too so you can set off chain reactions.
