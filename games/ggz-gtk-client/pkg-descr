=================================

The GGZ Gaming Zone GTK+ Client provides a GTK+ 1.2 or GTK+ 2.x user
interface for logging into a GGZ server, chatting with other players,
and locating and launching game tables.

This version of the GTK+ Client (0.0.13) requires version 0.0.13 of the
ggz-client-libs.

    communications between client modules and the GGZ servers
  * ggz-client-libs -  provides common procedures and utilites required
    to run the GGZ client and games
  * gtk-games/kde-games/sdl-games - one or more games or game packs are
    required in order to launch and play games
