Reaper Bot is a Quake 1 modification that adds bot support to the game.

Things the Reaper can do, that you cannot include:

  - Ability to grab the rocket or grenade launcher without being physically
    near it.

  - Faster rate of fire.  From rockets to nails the Reaper has you beat on
    quantity, so you better be focusing on quality shots.

  - Perfect aim.  A Reaper bot will never miss its target when firing the
    shotgun.
