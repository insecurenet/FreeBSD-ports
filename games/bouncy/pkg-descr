You play Bouncy the Hungry Rabbit.

You're in a garden with yummy veggies and a farmer who's not keen on you
eating them. You can hide (and move around) under the ground.

Bouncy was written so it could be enjoyed by my daughter,
who is about to turn 3, and by older gamers. Hence it's not a violent game
and "easy" is really, really easy, and "hard" is challenging.
