The tetris command runs a display-based game.  The object is to fit
shapes together to form complete rows, which then vanish.  When the
shapes fill up to the top, the game ends.  You can optionally select a
level of play or custom-select control keys.

This port is made of OpenBSD's tetris games. It got there from NetBSD...
