Columns is a nice little implementation of columns, the game we all
used to play on our Game Gears...  If you like it, play it.  If you
find any bugs, go ahead and fix them.  If you have some nice ideas
concerning the game, well, just implement them. The source is in
the public domain, so you may do everything you like with it.  If
you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to drop me a
line.
