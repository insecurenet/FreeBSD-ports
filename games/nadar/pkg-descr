N.A.D.A.R. is a network tank battle game. You can play N.A.D.A.R. with
computer players and human players over the network.

This port installs "/usr/X11R6/bin/nadars" and "/usr/X11R6/bin/nadar".
"nadars" is a server of N.A.D.A.R. Run it before playing N.A.D.A.R.
"nadar" is a client of N.A.D.A.R. for X. Run it after nadars starts.

  server-machine> nadars
  client-machine1> nadar -s [Server's hostname] -p [Player's name]
  client-machine2> nadar -s [Server's hostname] -p [Player's name]
  ...

If playing speed is very slow, Run nadar as below with size option.

  client-machine> nadar -s [Server's hostname] -p [Player's name] -size 30
