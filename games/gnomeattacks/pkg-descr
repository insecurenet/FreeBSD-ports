Oh no! The fair city is under attack by a GNOME logo that drops bombs! You
must destroy the city before the logo crashes into a building!

Wait, no, that's not right. Oh no! There is a city standing in the way of
the GNOME logo you're trying to fly around. You must destroy the buildings
before they crash into your flying logo.

Either way, the game is so simple to play that your cat could potentially
earn the high score just by walking across the keyboard. GNOME Attacks!

This game also features one of the coolest splash screens ever.
