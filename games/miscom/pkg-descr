In miscom you must defend cities from missile attack. You do this by
launching missiles of your own (in a point-and-blast fashion) to
destroy the enemy missiles before they land.

Miscom is a curses-based game, so it should work on any terminal.
(You'll need 9600 baud or better for it to be playable.) It supports
colour and sound.
