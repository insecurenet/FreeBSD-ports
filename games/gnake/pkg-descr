Gnake is a Nibbles clone for GNU/Linux and *BSD.
It's played on a terminal (controlled by the curses library) with the
keyboard: the game is really simple and that's why I like playing it even in
the oh-my-god-my-graphics-card-costs-more-than-the-rest-of-the-computer era.

For the list of available options, type ``gnake -h''.
