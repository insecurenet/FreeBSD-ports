This is a clone of the game Kye for Windows, originally by Colin Garbutt. It
is a puzzle game, which is a little like the old falling-rocks puzzle games,
and perhaps also inspired a little by Sokoban. But Kye has more variety of
objects, and so is capable of posing quite complex puzzles.

This clone is written by Colin Phipps <cph@moria.org.uk> in Python and uses
gtk. So it will run on modern Linux systems easily enough, and indeed should
work on any system with working Python and pygtk. It works on Windows as well,
for instance.
