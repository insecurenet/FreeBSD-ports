Childsplay is a 'suite' of educational games for young children, like
gcompris, but without the overkill of GNOME environment. Also the use of
the SDL libraries makes smooth animation and the playing of sound very
easy. Childsplay uses a plugin system for the games, so you might want
to check the childsplay-plugins page. (There are two built-in games;
Memory and a typing game)
