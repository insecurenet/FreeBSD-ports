This is a Chinese Checkers game, it has 5 AI players, and can easily support
more for any hackers out there. It uses SDL and runs great in plain X11.
It has some fun effects to liven things up a bit.

Multiplayer is supported on the same computer, although a net player would
not be hard to add given the plugin player feature.
