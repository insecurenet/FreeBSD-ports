SchwarzWeiss is german and means "black/white".
This game was created 2010 during a 48-hour-game-creating contest at Viennas
Metalab computer lab. The theme was "black and white" (or was it "grid"?)
and only public available resources were allowed.
Lucky for me, that included ThePythonGameBook. In effect I worked around 3 hours
in the evening and around 4 hours in the next morning.
After that I lost interest and presented the game to the other participants
in the Metalab to make use of the weekend for non-computer related activities.
While I'm proud to report that I was the first participant to present a
"playable" game (way before the deadline) I'm less proud to report the results
of test-playing against the other coders. It turned out that while my game is
playable, it is simply boring and not much fun.
Also I got beaten in my own game by people who never played the game before.
