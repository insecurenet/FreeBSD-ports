AEstats reads game log files for just about all shooters, converts them into
platform independent log format (meta log format), and generates meaningful
(and very pretty!) stats and ranking pages in HTML form.  Overall features:

  * Split into two executables to make the code more modular (independent
    of specific games/mod).  This also makes updates quicker and less prone
    to new bugs.
  * Modules are command line driven, giving you the maximum control of the
    the executables, without having to deal with klutzy platform dependent
    interfaces.  This makes it possible to control the modules via batch
    files or scripts.  Ideal for automating calls.
  * HTML output is eatable by any browser with frames.  Since plain HTML
    code is generated, any user should be able to view the output.
  * Provides an UnrealScript module (aeonsdmmod.u) that will generate
    extra log info, since Unreal does not provide any frag obituaries by
    default.
