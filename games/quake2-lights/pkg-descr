This is a modification for Quake II which adds lights and lots of effects
for the weapons shots.

This mod is intended to play it with Quake2Max supported binaries because
the lights and effects are better saw compared to original Quake2 binaries.

This mod introduces a lot of new commands, scanner, flashlight, decoys,
defense laser, chasecam, hook, etc.  Some keys in the autoexec.cfg are set
by default.

Single player game is also playable with this mod.
