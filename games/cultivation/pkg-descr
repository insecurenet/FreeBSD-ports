Cultivation is quite different from most other games. It is a social
simulation, and the primary form of conflict is over land and plant
resources---there is no shooting, but there are plenty of angry
looks. It is also an evolution simulation. Within the world of
Cultivation, you can explore a virtually infinite spectrum of
different plant and gardener varieties.

All of the graphics, sounds, melodies,and other content in Cultivation
are 100% procedurally generated at playtime. In other words, there
are no hand-painted texture maps---instead, each object has a
uniquely "grown" appearance. Every time you play, Cultivation
generates fresh visuals, music, and behaviors.
