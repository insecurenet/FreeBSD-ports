Capture the Flag offers an exciting variation on team play.  It gives more
meaning to base defense along with offensive positioning and organized
strikes.

The basic premise is this:

Attack the enemy base, grab their flag, then take it back to your base.  In
this variation you must touch your base flag when carrying the enemy flag in
order to score -- if your flag isn't at your base when you return, you or
your team must get it back to gain points and captures.
