.Sh DESCRIPTION
Inform7 for FreeBSD is a CLI implementation of the Inform 7 programming
language and environment by Graham Nelson.  Inform is a design system
for interactive fiction (IF) based on natural language.

Interactive fiction is a literary form which involves programming a
computer so that it presents a reader with a text which can be explored.
Inform aims to make the burden of learning to program such texts as
light as possible.  It is a tool for writers intrigued by computing, and
computer programmers intrigued by writing.  Perhaps these are not so
very different pursuits, in their rewards and pleasures:

    The sheer joy of making things... the fascination of fashioning
    complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and
    watching them work in subtle cycles... the delight of working in
    such a tractable medium.  The programmer, like the poet, works only
    slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.  He builds his castles in
    the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.
    (Frederick P. Brooks, "The Mythical Man-Month", 1972)

Inform7 for FreeBSD (CLI edition) implements the same basic features of
the GUI edition.  You can write, compile, debug, and replay your own
interactive fiction stories.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line arguments are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl
create Z-code v8 release.
.It Fl g
create Glulx release.
.It Fl h
show usage.
.It Fl r
replay game from a transcript file.
.It Fl w
replay game from a walkthrough file.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.nf
The most basic use of Inform7 for FreeBSD is:

$ i7 story.ni

which compiles your source story file into a Z-code v8 release.

If you have a transcript file from game, you can use the -r option to
replay it in story.z8

$ i7 -r story.scr story.z8

You will receive three files.
story.$$.scr - new transcript file
story.$$.key - walkthrough file
story.$$.sav - save game from a transcript file

You can also construct a simple walkthrough file and then automatically
replay its sequence of commands in your stories.

Example of a story.key
VERBOSE
L
N
W
GET LAMP
SCORE

A walkthrough file can be very short, meant just to test some sequence
of commands within your story, or it can be a full solution walkthrough.

$ i7 -w story.key story.z8

Once again you will receive three files.
story.$$.scr - new transcript file
story.$$.key - walkthrough file
story.$$.sav - save game from a walkthrough file
