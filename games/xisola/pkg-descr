Xisola game follow this simple rule:
Each move consists of two actions: first move your piece to an
adjascent empty field (horizontal, vertical or diagonal, like
the king in Chess), then take away any of the empty fields
Since the number of fields decreases with every move there will
be a point when one player will not have any empty fields left
to move to and he loses.
