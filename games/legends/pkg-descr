Legends is a fast-paced first-person-perspective online multiplayer game
released as freeware (software license). The game is designed to take
advantage of the beautiful environments available from the Torque engine it is
based on, while still offering the breakneck pacing and variety of styles
available from such classics as Quake and Tribes.

Gameplay is not the strafe-strafe-jump-strafe-shoot-strafe-run-like-hell style
a lot of games espouse; the addition of a jetpack adds a third dimension of
mobility that makes skill, forethought, and restraint necessities to winning.

Team sizes are ideal between 10 and 15 on each side, and the network code
allows 56k upwards to play smoothly. Game type offerings range from the
classic Capture the Flag, Deathmatch and Duel to our own new types, e.g..
'War'.

Plenty of maps are provided by us, but the beauty of this game is its
customization possibilities. Mission creation has never been easier, with a
stable, full-featured editor integrated into the game engine itself. Skins,
models, and effects can all be modified by the end-user with commonly
available tools. The game has an Autodownload feature which means you never
have to leave the game to join new user created Client-Side and Server-Side
missions.
