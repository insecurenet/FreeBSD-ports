These are the 3, 4, and 5 man tablebases for crafty's endgames.  If
you are truly blessed with disk space, you may also want to install
the games/crafty-tablebases-pawns port.

Be warned that all of these togther will eat up around 7.1 Gigs of
your disk space, or 14.2G, if you don't delete the distfiles (I highly
recommend doing this, as these files almost never change).
