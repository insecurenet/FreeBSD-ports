Vega Strike is an open source, 3D space simulator.  Work is proceeding on
both the Vega Strike game engine and a Vega Strike Universe game data set.
Both engine and data are in a playable state, but still under development.
Each release serves as a beta for both engine and data.  Current features
include:

  * Trading
  * Exploration
  * Plenty of shoot 'em up action
  * Preliminary multiplayer deathmatch (testing server only)
