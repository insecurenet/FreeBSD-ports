=======================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - GTK+ Game Modules
=======================================

GGZ Gaming Zone GTK+ Game Modules provide the game executables,
graphics, and data for a number of popular (and unique) network games.
These games are coded for version 2.X of GTK+, but many of them are also
available using different graphical interfaces.

This version of the GTK+ Game Modules (0.0.13) requires version 0.0.13
of the ggz-client-libs.

The GTK+ Game Modules are only one part of the GGZ Gaming Zone
client setup.  The following additional modules are required:
  * libggz - provides commonly used functions and low-level
    communications between client modules and the GGZ servers
  * ggz-client-libs - provides common procedures and utilites required
    to run the GGZ client and games
  * gtk-client/kde-client - one or more of the GGZ clients will be
    required in order to login to a server, chat and launch games
