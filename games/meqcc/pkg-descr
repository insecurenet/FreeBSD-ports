This is a modification to the QuakeC compiler from id Software.  It allows
creating `progs.dat' file which cannot be decompiled to QuakeC source code.
As an added bonus, such `progs.dat' file is a lot smaller.

The compiler also has a C compatible precompiler.  A description of the
precompiler directives can be found in a regular C manual.
