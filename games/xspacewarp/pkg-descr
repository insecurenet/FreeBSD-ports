In xspacewarp the player maneuvers a Federation spaceship,
called the Endever, through 81 sectors of space trying to
destroy an Armada of enemy Jovian ships before they destroy the
all the Federation bases. To accompish this task, the Endever
has fasers, ion thrust engines, warpdrive for jumping between
sectors, a limited number of photon torpedoes, and a finite
store of energy which gets depleted during battles and must be
replenished by docking with the bases. The game has no time
limit and has a choice of 10 skill levels. xspacewarp also has
an online orientation to explain the game in further detail.
