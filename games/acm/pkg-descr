ACM is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation. My main
design objective was to provide source code that could be easily
compiled and executed on a wide variety of platforms. To that end,
acm is written entirely in C, exploiting the programming features of
Unix, X11, and the BSD socket interface.

Players engage in air to air combat against one another using heat
seeking missiles and cannons.

ACM is implemented as two programs. The first, named "acm", is a small
program that, when invoked, starts a flight session on a given
workstation. The second component, named "acms", is a server process
that manages the multiplayer environment. It also manages the flight
simulation and display management that is required. Most players will
prefer to run the acms process on a back-end server system on their
local area network. Players at client workstations can then invoke the
acm program to begin play.
