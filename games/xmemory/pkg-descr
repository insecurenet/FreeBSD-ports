XMemory is a multi player memory game. It can be played simultaneously on
several X Displays, which have to be listed on the command-line. Like in
the traditional memory game, the players have to find similar tiles on the
table to get the tiles. The main difference to this game is, that the
players really play simultaneous and therefor the whole game gets
some kind of an action game.
