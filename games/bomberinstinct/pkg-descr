BomberInstinct is a multiplayer-only Bomberman-like game. It plays only on a
single computer at the moment, with keyboard or joystick. It's part like
Bomberman, because you must kill the other players with bombs that throw flames
vertically and horizontally, but it's much more strategical because you have to
do with the elements of a maze (arrows, tunnels, teleportations, and many
more...), and with the special powers of each character.
