Liquid War is a unique multiplayer wargame. Its rules are truely
original and have been invented by Thomas Colcombet. You control
an army of liquid and have to try and eat your opponents. A single
player mode is available, but the game is definitely designed to
be multiplayer, and has network support.

When playing Liquid War, one has to eat one's opponent. There can
be from 2 to 6 players. There are no weapons, the only thing you
have to do is to move a cursor in a 2-D battlefield. This cursor
is followed by your army, which is composed by a great many little
fighters. Fighters are represented by small colored squares. All
the fighters who have the same color belong to the same team. One
very often controls several thousands fighters at the same time.
And when fighters from different teams meet, they eat each other,
it is as simple as that.

Note: If the game crashes this might resolve it:
    Inside liquidwar, go to options->rules->advanced and change
    Algorithm from "Assembly" to "Standard C"
See also the "ASM" option in the port build options.
