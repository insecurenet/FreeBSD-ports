This game is played in a parallelepipede containing PxNxN little
cubes. You can first consider this 3D board as P 2D checkerboards of
NxN squares.  From 2 up to 10 players can confront each other.
Each player begins with a certain number of pieces (or armies) that
he has to move and make attack. One of his pieces represents him-self
(or the chief, or the king, or anything you want). If this piece die,
the player is eliminated. The last player staying alive wins.
Messages can be sent to the other players , so that alliances can be
implemented.  A special timer assures that the game remains dynamic.
