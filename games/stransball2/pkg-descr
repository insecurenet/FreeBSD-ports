"Super Transball 2" is the sequel of "Transball" and "Transball 2",
Inspired in THRUST type of games (and concretely in ZARA THRUSTA
for the Amiga 500). In each level of Transball, the goal is to find
the SPHERE, capture it and carry it to the upper part of the level.
The main obstacle is the gravity, that impulses you towards the
ground. But many other obstacles, canons, tanks, doors, etc. will
try to make difficult your journey...
