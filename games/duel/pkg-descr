A simple, easy to understand game. From an overhead perspective, pilot your
little ship around with the arrow keys, shooting your way (with the space bar)
through about twenty levels of action and gorgeous (_cough_) 3d graphics. In
theory, all you windows folks need to do is extract the archive, and double
click the exe. In theory. Sorry, I never got round to adding sound - but look
on the bright side, at least you can use it at work without anyone noticing. :)
