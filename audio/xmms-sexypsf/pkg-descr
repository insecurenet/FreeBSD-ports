Sexypsf is an XMMS plugin for playing .psf files.

The PSF format brings the functionality of NSF, SID, SPC, and GBS to next-
generation consoles.  PSF utilizes the original music driver code from each
game to replay sequenced music in a perfectly authentic, and size-efficient,
way.

The general idea is that a PSF file contains a zlib-compressed program which,
if executed on the real console, would simply play the music.
