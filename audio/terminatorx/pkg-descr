terminatorX is a realtime audio synthesizer that allows you to "scratch"
on digitally sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.mp3, etc.) the way
hiphop-DJs scratch on vinyl records.

It features multiple turntables, realtime effects (built-in as well as
LADSPA plugin effects), a sequencer and an easy-to-use gtk+ GUI.
