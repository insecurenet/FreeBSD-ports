eXtace is a Audio Visualization plugin for the X-Window System. It connects to
ESD (Enlightened Sound Daemon) and displays the audio data as either a 3D
textured landscape, 3d pointed landscape, 16-256 channel graphic EQ, a
multi-mode Oscilloscope, or a Spectragram. All modes are fully scalable to
nearly ANY resolution!
