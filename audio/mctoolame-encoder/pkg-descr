A multi-channel MPEG encoder, using the ISO13818 standard and the dist10
source code.  Multi-channel files may have up to 6 defined channels:
Left(L), Right(R), Center(C), Left Surround (LS), Right Surround (RS) and
a Low Frequency Enhancement channel (LFE).

ISO13818 defines 5 multi-channel modes (on top of the normal stereo mode),
each of these modes may have an optional LFE channel:

    3/2: L, R, C, LS, RS
    3/1: L, R, C, mono surround
    2/2: L, R, LS, RS
    2/1: L, R, mono surround
    3/0: L, R, C

The "standard" surround sound encoding of "5.1 channels" is achieved by
using mode 3/2 plus an LFE channel.

A multi-channel MPEG file should decode OK on any MPEG decoder.  If the
decoder doesn't recognize the multi-channel extensions, then you'll just
get a stereo file containing a down mix of the 5 channels.
