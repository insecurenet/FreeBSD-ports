WMalbum is a dock applet that displays album covers for songs being
played by XMMS. You must already have images of the album covers stored
near the file being played. WMAlbum provides a handy circular menu
for play/skip/etc, and can replace wmxmms. Although dock applets are
designed for the WindowMaker window manager, they also work in other
window managers including openbox and blackbox.
