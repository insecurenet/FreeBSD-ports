Pd is a real-time graphical programming environment for audio and graphical
processing.  It resembles the Max/MSP system but is much simpler and more

via Mark Dank's GEM package, Pd can be used for simultaneous computer
animation and computer audio.  Second, an experimental facility is provided
for defining and accessing data structures.
