tosha reads CD-DA (digital audio) and CD-XA (digital video)
tracks and writes them to the hard disk.  Several audio formats
are supported:  raw PCM (little-endian and big-endian byte
order), WAV / RIFF, AIFF and Sun AU.

You can also pipe the data directly into an audio or video
player.  A simple audio player is included ("pcmplay").  To
playback VideoCD data, you need a third-party product, for
example MpegTV (see http://www.mpegtv.com/).

tosha reads the digital audio / video data through the SCSI
bus; therefore it does not work with IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drives
nor with proprietary interfaces.
