The last.fm fingerprint library

The fingerprinting process works in two steps:
1. Get PCM data and pass it to *fplib* which will return byte string to be
   submitted to the last.fm HTTP fingerprint service. This will return a number
   (fingerprintID).
2. Query the last.fm API with the fingerprintID and obtain the metadata in xml
   format.

The lastfmfpclient directory contains an example of application that uses fplib
and queries both services.
