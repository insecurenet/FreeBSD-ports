SoundTracker is a pattern-oriented music editor (similar to the classic DOS
program FastTracker and the Amiga legend ProTracker).  Samples can be lined
up on tracks and patterns which are then arranged to a song.

Supported module formats are XM and MOD; the player code is the one from
OpenCP.  A basic sample recorder and editor is also included.
