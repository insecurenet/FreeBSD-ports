nekobee is a DSSI soft synth plugin that emulates the sound of the
TB-303 Bassline. It is not an exact copy; rather than make it "just like
the real thing", the design concentrates on modelling the circuitry and
was adjusted by comparing the sounds achievable with it to those heard
on classic acid house tracks. It includes a switchable square/saw wave
VCO, 24dB/octave VCF, an adjustable decay time for the VCF, a fixed
decay time for the VCA, and an interesting bit of circuitry around the
"Accent" control.
