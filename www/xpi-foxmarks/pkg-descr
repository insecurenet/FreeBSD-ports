If you use Firefox on more than one computer, you'll want Foxmarks. Install
Foxmarks on each computer, and it will work silently in the background to
keep your bookmarks synchronized. As a bonus, log in to my.foxcloud.com from
any computer anywhere to access your bookmarks.

A simple wizard guides you through the startup process. After that, just
forget about it. It's simple and solid.
