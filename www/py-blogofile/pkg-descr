Blogofile is a simple blog engine that requires no database and no
special hosting environment. You customize a set of templates with Mako,
create posts in a markup language like Textile, or Markdown, (or even
plain HTML) and Blogofile generates your entire blog as plain HTML, CSS,
images, and Atom/RSS feeds which you can then upload to any old web
server you like. No CGI or scripting environment is needed on the
server.
