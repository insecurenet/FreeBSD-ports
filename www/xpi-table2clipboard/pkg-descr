Mozilla applications allow to select rows and columns
from a table simply pressing Control key and picking
rows/columns with left mouse button.

The selection can be copied to clipboard but the original
table disposition is lost making ugly results when you
paste the text on datasheet applications (eg excel).

If you want to paste data in Microsoft Excel on OpenOffice
Calc with correct disposition simply use Table2Clipboard.

Pasting in plain text editors is also supported as CSV
file (but you can change rows and columns separators
from option dialog)
