-------------------------------------------
Congratulations, FluxBB is now installed!

To complete the installation , please:
1) Create a user and a database for FluxBB to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration file
   httpd.conf, and restart the server:

   For Apache versions earlier than 2.4:

   Alias /fluxbb %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

   For Apache version 2.4.x or above:

   Alias /fluxbb %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%/>
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

3) Visit your FluxBB site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/fluxbb/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up FluxBB.
