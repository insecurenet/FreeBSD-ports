Ever started type into an edit box on some web page
(such as to post a comment or describe why your
scooter was defective and they should send you new
one)?

If so, then you need "It's All Text!"

This miracle extension provides an edit button for
any edit box[1] on any page or your money back[2]!

At the bottom right corner of any edit box, a little
edit button will appear. Click it. If this is the
first time you've used "It's All Text!" then you will
be asked to set your preferences, most importantly
the editor.

The web page will pop up in your selected editor.
When you save it, it'll refresh in the web page.
Wait for the magic yellow glow that means that the
radiation has taken effect!
