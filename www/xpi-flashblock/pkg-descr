Flashblock is an extension for the Mozilla, Firefox, and Netscape browsers that
takes a pessimistic approach to dealing with Macromedia Flash content on a
webpage and blocks ALL Flash content from loading. It then leaves placeholders
on the webpage that allow you to click to download and then view the Flash
content.
