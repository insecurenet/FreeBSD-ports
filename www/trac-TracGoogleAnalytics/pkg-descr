Previously known as Google Analytics Plugin, this plugin will enable
your trac environment to be logged by Google Analytics.

It adds the necessary javascript code to log your environment, plus, it
also logs the downloads of regular filenames which end with a specific
extension; these extensions are defined by you; and also external links.
