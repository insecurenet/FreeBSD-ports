Planet is a flexible feed aggregator, this means that it downloads feeds
and aggregates their content together into a single combined feed with
the latest news first.

It uses Mark Pilgrim's Ultra-liberal feed parser so can read from RDF, RSS
and Atom feeds and Tomas Styblo's template library to output static files
in unlimited formats based on a series of templates.

Planet was written for the Planet Debian and Planet GNOME websites by
Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com> and
Jeff Waugh <jdub@perkypants.org>.  It was originally based on 'spycyroll'.
