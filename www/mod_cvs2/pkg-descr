mod_cvs recognizes if the files in your webtree are checked out
from a CVS repository. If so, it checks if the file is up-to-date
and, if not, updates it.

Another neat feature of mod_cvs is the date-checkout feature. You
can specify a date in the URI that gets passed to CVS, which checks
out an older revision of the requested file and sends it to the
user.
