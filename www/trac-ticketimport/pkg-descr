This plugin lets you import into Trac a series of tickets from a CSV
file or (if the xlrd library is installed) from an Excel file.

You can also use it to modify tickets in batch, by saving a report as
CSV, editing the CSV file, and re-importing the tickets.

This plugin is very useful when starting a new project: you can import a
list of requirements that may have come from meeting notes, list of
features, other ticketing systems... It's also great to review the
tickets off-line, or to do massive changes to tickets.

Based on the ticket id (or, if no id exists, on the summary) in the
imported file, tickets are either created or updated.
