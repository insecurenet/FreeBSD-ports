htmlpp is a Perl[45] script that allows easy maintaining of Web sites of
any size, by allowing you to create "template" HTML files using a form of
page description language.  It will even turn plain-text files into
quick-n-dirty, yet nicely formatted HTML using the "GURU mode" feature.
Documentation is included in HTML format
(stored in /usr/local/share/doc/htmlpp), and since the documentation was
produced using htmlpp itself, you can take a look at the source file (also
installed) to see an example of how to use htmlpp.
