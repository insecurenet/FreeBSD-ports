Stylish is an extension that allows easy management of user styles.
User styles empower your browsing experience by letting you fix ugly
sites, customize the look of your browser or mail client, or just have
fun. With an online repository at userstyles.org, you don't even need
to know how to write styles yourself; just a couple clicks and the
chosen style is applied. Stylish is to CSS what Greasemonkey is to
JavaScript, and unlike other methods of using user styles, most styles
take effect immediately.
