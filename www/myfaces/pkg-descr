The first free open source JavaServer(tm) Faces implementation.

JavaServer(tm) Faces is a new and upcoming web application framework that
accomplishes the MVC paradigm. It is comparable to the well-known Struts
Framework but has features and concepts that are beyond those of Struts;
especially the component orientation.
