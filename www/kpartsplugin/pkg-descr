KParts Plugin implements a plugin for Netscape-compatible browsers in
Unix environments. This plugin uses KDE KParts technology to embed
file viewers (e.g., for PDF files) into non-KDE browsers. Tested
browsers include both Mozilla Firefox and Opera, and it is know to
work with Chrome and Arora.

With this plugin, you can, e.g., view PDF files in Firefox using
Okular as an embedded plugin. Any KDE KPart will be automatically made
available as a browser plugin.
