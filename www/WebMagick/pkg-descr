WebMagick is a package which supports making image collections
available on the Web. It recurses through directory trees, building
HTML pages and imagemap files to allow the user to navigate through
collections of thumbnail images (somewhat similar to xv's Visual
Schnauzer) and select the image to view with a mouse click (see sample
output). Every effort is made to minimize the bandwidth required
between the server and the browser.
