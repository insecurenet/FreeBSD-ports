PHP5 rewrite of HTTP_Request package. Provides cleaner API and pluggable
Adapters. Currently available are:
* Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
* Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
* Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.

Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, authentication,
cookies, proxies, gzip and deflate encodings, monitoring the request
progress with Observers.
