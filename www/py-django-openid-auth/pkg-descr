A library that can be used to add OpenID support to Django
applications.  The library integrates with Django's builtin
authentication system, so most applications require minimal changes to
support OpenID login.

The library also includes the following features:
 * Basic user details are transfered from the OpenID server via the
   Simple Registration extension.
 * It can be configured to use a fixed OpenID server URL, for use in
   single sign on deployments.
 * It supports the Launchpad teams extension to request team
   membership information.
