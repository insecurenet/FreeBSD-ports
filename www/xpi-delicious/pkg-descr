This is an extension to ease the use of the del.icio.us website: a
social bookmarking, social software web service for storing and sharing
web bookmarks.

A non-hierarchical keyword categorization system is used on del.icio.us
where users can tag each of their bookmarks with a number of freely
chosen keywords. A combined view of everyone's bookmarks with a given
tag is available.
