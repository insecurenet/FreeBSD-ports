# This may be done for us already by apxs during install:

#LoadModule websh_module       %%APACHEMODDIR%%/mod_websh.so

# Add the following to your Apache config file or, if you use
# Apache-2.x, simply drop into the %%PREFIX%%/%%APACHEETCDIR%%/Includes
# 

<IfModule mod_websh.c>

# add handlers for the file you want to process
# in this example, we treat .whtml files as SSI type
# html files that contain websh snipplets and .ws3 files
# as websh scripts (CGI-like) -> websh.conf

AddHandler websh .whtml
AddHandler websh .ws3
# The vendor-distributed version passes ALL .html files
# through mod_websh, which slows your server down. In this
# example only files named *.whtml (and .ws3) get processed
# by the module.
