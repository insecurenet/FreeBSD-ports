One Password To Rule Them All!

If you're like most people, you have a few passwords that you use over
and over again on many different websites. You know this isn't secure,
but you do it anyway. Why? Because it's difficult to remember a unique
password for each and every web site that requires one.

PasswordMaker manages all your online accounts using either new,
uncrackable passwords it creates, or your existing passwords. It even
automatically populates webforms for one-click login.

Moreover, passwords aren't stored anywhere--they are calculated over and over
again as they're needed--so there's nothing to be lost, hacked, or stolen!
