HTTP is changing under our feet. HTTP/1.1, our old friend, is being
supplemented by the brand new HTTP/2 standard. HTTP/2 provides many
benefits: improved speed, lower bandwidth usage, better connection
management, and more.

hyper supports the final draft of the HTTP/2 specification:
additionally, it provides support for drafts 14, 15, and 16 of the
HTTP/2 specification. It  also supports the final draft of the HPACK
specification
