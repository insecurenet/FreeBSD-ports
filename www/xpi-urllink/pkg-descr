URL Link is a small extension that allows you to select a non-URL in a
mail/news message or web-page, and open it in a browser window.

For emails, it reconnects links in emails which have been broken across
several lines, and also replaces spaces with the URL character code %20
so that you may follow emailed network 'file:' links (which it auto-
detects from Windows X: or servdir references).

For web pages, it also allows you to select textual links/URLs in web
pages or edit boxes, and follow them as if they were real links. It
will always let you follow links and also analyses mailto: links.
