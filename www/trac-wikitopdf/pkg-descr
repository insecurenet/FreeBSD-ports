WikiToPdf combines the functionality of CombineWikiPlugin and
PageToPdfPlugin on only one plugin and allows one to setup a template
file used to generate the PDF file with a cover and a licence page, for
example.

At the end of each wiki page there is a link named WikiToPdf and
works like athomas PageToPdfPlugin plugin but takes into account the
parameters on trac.ini (see below) and passes them to htmldoc.

Alternatively, it's possible to select one or more wiki pages and
generate one single PDF file just like coderanger work with a cover and
a licence from a template file. This feature also takes into account the
parameters on trac.ini.
