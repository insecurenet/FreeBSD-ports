The HTML::Summary module produces summaries from the textual content of
web pages. It does so using the location heuristic, which determines the value
of a given sentence based on its position and status within the document; for
example, headings, section titles and opening paragraph sentences may be
favoured over other textual content. A LENGTH option can be used to restrict
the length of the summary produced.

This distribution contains the HTML::Summary module, and some supporting
modules. The full list of modules is:

HTML::Summary
Text::Sentence
Lingua::JA::Jcode
