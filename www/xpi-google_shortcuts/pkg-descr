Display all of your Google Services as buttons just next to your addressbar
or anywhere you like it!

You can go to settings to change which services should be available for you
as buttons. Left click on a button opens the service in the current tab,
MIDDLE CLICK opens a new tab. If you like you can change the main appearance
from a Toolbar with all buttons you've selected to a single Dropdown Menu.
