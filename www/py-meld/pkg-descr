A simple, lightweight system for manipulating HTML (and XML, informally) using
a Pythonic object model.

Features:
 - Allows program logic and HTML to be completely separated - a graphical
   designer can design the HTML in a visual HTML editor, without needing to
   deal with any non-standard syntax or non-standard attribute names.
 - Designed with common HTML-application programming tasks in mind.
 - No special requirements for the HTML/XML (or just one: attribute values must
   be quoted) - so you can use any editor, and your HTML/XML doesn't need to be
   strictly valid.
 - Works by string substitution, rather than by decomposing and rebuilding the
   markup, hence has no impact on the parts of the page you don't manipulate.
 - Does nothing but manipulating HTML/XML, hence fits in with any other Web
   toolkits you're using.
 - Tracebacks always point to the right place - many Python/HTML mixing systems
   use exec or eval, making bugs hard to track down.
