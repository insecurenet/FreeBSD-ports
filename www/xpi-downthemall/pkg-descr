Why do we have to load a slow external download manager/accelerator,
when we can just have DownThemAll inside Firefox?

DownThemAll lets you download all the links or images contained in a
webpage and much more: you can refine your downloads by fully
customizable criteria to get only what you really want.

DownThemAll is all you can desire from a download manager: it features
an advanced accelerator that increases speed up to 400%, it allows you
to pause and resume downloads at any time and, last but not least,
it's fully integrated into your favorite browser!
