jToolkit is a Python web application framework built on modpython and
Apache. There is also a simple command line webserver for running
applications from.

It is aimed at dynamically generated pages rather than mostly-static
pages (for which there are templating solutions). Pages can be produced
using a variety of widgets. It handles sessions and database
connections (and multi-database portability).
