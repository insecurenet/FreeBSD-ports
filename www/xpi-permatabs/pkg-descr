Turn tabs of your choice into permanent tabs. PermaTabs can't be closed
accidentally no matter what you click (even actions like "Close other tabs"
will not affect them) and will stick around between sessions.

Ideal for keeping URLs you use often, always one tab away. Also, ideal
for picking up specific articles where you left off during a previous session.

From first installation PermaTabs includes three random sample tabs
(from a built in list) to get you started. Maybe you'll discover a useful site
you never knew about?

Adding or removing a permatab is simple - right click a site's tab,
and check/uncheck "Permanent Tab".

Must read: one of the default permatabs installed on first installation
is an affiliate URL to eBay.com. You can of course remove this and the other
sample permatabs, and create your own (which is the whole idea).
