This plugin uses the blog change interface in FullBlogPlugin to send out
email notifications for:
 * new posts
 * updated posts
 * comment added
 * deleted posts

Email notifications are sent to the user who made the change.
Notifications can also be sent to other users or a distribution list by
specifying the smtp_always_cc option.

The emails are sent in plain text using a template that was modeled
after Trac's ticket_notify_email template.

If you are using the AnnouncerPlugin, you should use its FullBlogPlugin
rather than the FullBlogNotificationPlugin.
