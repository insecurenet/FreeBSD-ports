======================================================================

You can now switch between the different rendering engines in
Konqueror (a website must be open) through the menu:
View -> View Mode -> {KHTML, WebKit}. This change is not persistent.
If WebKit does not show up in Konqueror, run `kbuildsycoca4` and
restart Konqueror.

You can choose the default rendering engine in Konqueror's
configuration dialog under the "General" section.
