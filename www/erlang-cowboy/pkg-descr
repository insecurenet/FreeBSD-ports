Cowboy aims to provide a complete HTTP stack in a small code base. It
is optimized for low latency and low memory usage, in parts because it
uses binary strings.

Cowboy provides routing capabilities, selectively dispatching requests
to handlers written in Erlang.

Because it uses Ranch for managing connections, Cowboy can easily be
embedded in any other application.
