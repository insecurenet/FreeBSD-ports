FormAlchemy greatly speeds development with SQLAlchemy mapped classes
(models) in a HTML forms environment.

FormAlchemy eliminates boilerplate by autogenerating HTML input fields
from a given model. FormAlchemy will try to figure out what kind of
HTML code should be returned by introspecting the model's properties
and generate ready-to-use HTML code that will fit the developer's
application.
