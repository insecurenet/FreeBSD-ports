TagZilla is an add-on to Mozilla that lets you add a tagline, random or
specifically chosen by you, to the end of an email or newsgroup posting,
or to the clipboard for pasting into a Web-based email or message board.

What is a tagline?
A tagline is a one-line joke, witticism, factoid, what have you. It can
be about any subject (although it's good to ensure it's appropriate to
the forum in question). The random quotes that can be found at the end
of web pages like Slashdot or the MozDev home page could be considered
taglines.
