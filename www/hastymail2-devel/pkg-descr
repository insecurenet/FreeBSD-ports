Hastymail2 is a full featured IMAP/SMTP client written in PHP. Our goal is to
create a fast, secure, compliant web mail client that has great usability.
Hastymail2 is much more lightweight than most popular web based mail
applications but still maintains a competitive feature set. The project
originated as Hastymail in 2002, then was nearly completely rewritten as
Hastymail2 starting in January of 2008. We are very near our first stable
release of the second generation of Hastymail and development continues to be
active.
