This port offers the development branch of the XS-HTTPD webserver.
The stable version of XS-HTTPD is available as well, as www/xshttpd.

Development releases are updated much more often and will contain
all kinds of nice new features - some of them are even documented.

Read the ChangeLog file for possible issues with backwards compatibility.
