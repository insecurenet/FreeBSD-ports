Live, the "Live Interactive VDR Environment", is a plugin providing the
possibility to interactively control the VDR and some of it's plugins by
a web interface.

Unlike external utility programs that communicate with VDR and it's plugins
by SVDRP, Live has direct access to VDR's data structures and is thus very
fast.
