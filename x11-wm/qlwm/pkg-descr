This is a window manager based on the Qt library.  It supports
icons, keyboard controls, and virtual screens.  It comes with two
applets:  a biff-like mail indicator and a clock, both designed to
be swallowed by its toolbar.

Caution!  Killing this window manager will kill some of your X
clients (applications).
