Genmenu is a script capable of generating menus for Blackbox, Fluxbox,
Openbox, WindowMaker and Enlightenment. It works by checking the current
user's $PATH for a predefined list of binaries and adding them to menu
if they are found.

The following options can be configured during runtime:
    * Default font to use in all X terminals
    * Default X terminal (will be used to launch all console apps in the menu)
    * Default size of all web browser windows
    * Include menu for starting other window managers (yes|no)
