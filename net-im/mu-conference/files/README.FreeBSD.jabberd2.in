# MU-Conference and jabberd2 (net-im/jabberd) on FreeBSD
# README by Martin Matuska <mm_at_FreeBSD_dot_org>

The configuration for jabberd2 is located in:
%%TARGETDIR%%/etc/jabberd

If you are using Jabberd2 then you shouldn't have to do much configuration.
Make sure the 'mainServer' setting is the IP or hostname of your Jabber server,
and set 'port' to 5347. Double-check that the secret for legacy components 
in router.xml (for Jabberd2) is the same as the secret setting in config.py. 
That should be all. You don't even need to restart Jabberd2.
