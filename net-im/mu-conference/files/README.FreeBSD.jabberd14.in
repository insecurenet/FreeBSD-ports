# README by Martin Matuska <mm_at_FreeBSD_dot_org>

The sample configuration file for jabberd14 may be located in:
%%TARGETDIR%%/etc/jabber.xml.sample

Please make all necessary changes to your configuration file which may be:
%%TARGETDIR%%/etc/jabber.xml

NOTE: if you want this service to be accessible from other servers,
 change any 'conference.localhost' listed below to a fully qualified 
 domain name! Please make sure that your directives are _NOT_ in an XML 
 comment: there are many multi-line comments. 

To activate MU-Conference for your Jabber server, 
add the following to your configuration file and adjust to your settings
(around line 921 in the sample configuration file):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  <service id="conference.localhost">
    <accept>
      <ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
      <port>7009</port>
      <secret>password</secret>
    </accept>
  </service>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add this section to the browse area of the jsm to advertise it to
your users (around line 382 of the sample config):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	<item category="conference" type="public" jid="conference.localhost" name="Public Conferencing">
	  <ns>jabber:iq:conference</ns>
	</item>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be sure to restart your server after reconfiguring.
