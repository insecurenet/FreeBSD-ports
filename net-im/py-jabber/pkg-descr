jabber.py is a Python module for the jabber instant messaging protocol.
jabber.py deals with the xml parsing and socket code, leaving the programmer
to concentrate on developing quality jabber based applications with Python.

The eventual aim is to produce a fully featured easy to use library for
creating both jabber clients and servers.
