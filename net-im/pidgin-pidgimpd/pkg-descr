PidgiMPD is a Pidgin plugin for monitoring/controlling MPD.

PidgiMPD can do both automatic and manual tasks.
The manual tasks are handled via the command /mpc in conversation windows.
Help about that command can be found using the parameter help.

The automatic tasks are:
* Automatically set away message to user defined string OR set Pidgin TUNE
  status, if available. (TUNE status is supported in MSNP14 and Jabber)
* Automatically send currently playing song information to users in
  active conversations.

The syntax of the messages can be user configured.
