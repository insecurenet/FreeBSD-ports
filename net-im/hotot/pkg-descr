Hotot is a multi-column microblogging client written with HTML5 technologies
through Webkit.

It supports Twitter and Identi.ca services, as well as real-time update (via
Twitter streaming API), profile editing, multi-lingual, thread conversations,
three level in-app effects, trending topics detailed into city level, color
labels (assign colors to people).

For a geek, it has native notification system, HTTP/Socks proxy, vim-style
keyboard shortcuts, and a powerful Kismet content filter system which could
perform a few automated tasks, and speech input on Google Chrome.

It supports Instapaper/ReadItLater, Google tweet translation, geographic
information shown on Google Maps, plenty of image upload services including
Twitter official one (and their previews), video preview like YouTube, URL
shorten and unshorten (many beautiful prefixes), and user stats through the
internal extensions.
