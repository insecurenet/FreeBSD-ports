Phase is a widget style for Qt 4 and KDE 4. It is designed to be
functional but not drab, and aesthetic but not distracting.

Artistic design draws upon the genius of earlier masters. This is
particularly true for minimalistic designs. Therefore I cannot in
good conscience claim this look to be truly original. But I have
done my best. I hope you like it!

Phase is now being maintained in kdeartwork. These are only "snapshot"
releases. This is a "pure" Qt style, in that it does not require
KDE.
