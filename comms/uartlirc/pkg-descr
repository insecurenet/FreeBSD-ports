This is a driver for "homebrew" type serial LIRC reveivers as
described here:

	http://lirc.org/receivers.html

It overrides the `normal' uart(4) driver, if you have that driver
already loaded or statically in your kernel (like it is in GENERIC)
then you need to load uartlirc.ko from loader.conf(5) (or manually
via the loader prompt) for the override to work.  The driver provides
a /dev/lircX node for each serial port in addition to the normal
tty nodes /dev/cuauX etc, so you can still use other serial ports
normally should you have more than one.

Note: it only supports PCI/motherboard serial ports not ones connected
via USB, for USB you can use mceusb hardware supported via webcamd,
or FTDI hardware supported by comms/lirc natively via libftdi, see:

and the comms/lirc port's pkg-message.
