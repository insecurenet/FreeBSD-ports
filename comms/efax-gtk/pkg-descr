This program is a Gtk+/Gtkmm front end for the efax program for receiving and
sending faxes with a fax modem.  Any files to be faxed must be in postscript
format, which is the generic printer format for Unix/Linux systems.  The
program will use ghostscript to convert these into the Group 3 fax format which
the fax modem will understand.
