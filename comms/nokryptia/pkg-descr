Nokryptia is a program to convert music files like MP3 to work on a Nokia 5510
cell phone. The utility also does not do any encryption, it uses in fact a bug
in the encryption algorithm. Therefore, no actual encryption is done, which
makes the program very fast in comparison to the official software from Nokia.
