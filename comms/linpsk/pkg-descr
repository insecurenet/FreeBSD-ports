LinPsk is a program for operating on digital modes running on Linux.

LinPsk supports BPSK , QPSK and RTTY at the moment.

Main features are:

    the simultaneuos decoding of up to four channels.
    The different digital modes may be mixed
    You can define a trigger on each channel to be notified if a text of your choice is detected.
    You can log each received channel at a file.
    For easy qso'ing you can define macros and for larger texts to be send you can use two files.
    You can view the signal as spectrum or in a waterfall display. Both are scalable in the frequency domain.

At the Moment RTTY only supports 45 baud and 1.5 stopbits.
