 Sredird is designed to run under inetd control. The line in the inetd
 configuration file (usually /etc/inetd.conf) should look like this:
 
-sredir          stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/sredird -i 5 /dev/modem /var/lock/LCK..modem
+sredir         stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/sredird      sredird -i 5 /dev/cuaa0 /var/spool/lock/LCK..cuaa0
 
 Of course, "sredir" should be defined in the services file (usually
-/etc/services, usual values start at port 7000) and "/dev/modem" should
+/etc/services, usual values start at port 7000) and "/dev/cuaa0" should
 be substituted by the appropriate device. The lock and the device name
-must match for correct interlocking with other programs. The tcpd program
-is the usual tcp wrapper that's not needed for correct operation but
-is useful for security purposes. Don't forget to send a SIGHUP to the
-inetd daemon in order to force reload of the configuration file. The
-initial -i paramater is optional and enables compatibility with the
-Cisco IOS.
