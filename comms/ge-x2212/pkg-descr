This program is a software package for programming the X22C12 EEPROM
in the GE Phoenix SX radios (specifically the VHF and UHF 16 channel
scanning versions). The X2212 is removed from the radio, placed
in the parallel port adaper socket and can be read/written/verified
or archived. The prom contents can be saved in a hex file format
or exported as a text file for printing. Changing frequencies and
channel guard settings is as easy as filling in the blanks.
