A set of utilities to communicate with IrDA devices over an IrDA port
on a serial line.
Covers IrComm for connecting via PPP over cell phones
as well as several utilities to exchange data with PDAs.

These programs were written by Tommy Bohlin <tommy@gatespace.com>.
The port is more or less directly copied from Lennart Augustsson's
<lennart@augustsson.net> NetBSD port.
