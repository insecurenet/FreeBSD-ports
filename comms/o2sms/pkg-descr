o2sms is a program to send SMS messages using the websites of Irish mobile
operators. Despite its name, it supports all three major Irish operators - o2
Ireland, Vodafone Ireland and Meteor Ireland.

The program works by simulating a web browser's interaction with those
websites. In essence, the program is really just a stripped-down specialised
browser.

At the time of writing, o2 web accounts have 250 free web texts per month,
Vodafone 300 and Meteor 300. After sending a message, o2sms will tell you how
many you have remaining.
