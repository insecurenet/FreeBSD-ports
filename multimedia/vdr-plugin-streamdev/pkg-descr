This PlugIn is a VDR implementation of the VTP (Video Transfer Protocol)
Version 0.0.3 (see file PROTOCOL) and a basic HTTP Streaming Protocol.

It consists of a server and a client part, but both parts are compiled together
with the PlugIn source, but appear as separate PlugIns to VDR.

The client part acts as a full Input Device, so it can be used in conjunction
with a DXR3-Card, XINE, SoftDevice or others to act as a working VDR
installation without any DVB-Hardware including EPG-Handling.

The server part acts as a Receiver-Device and works transparently in the
background within your running VDR. It can serve multiple clients and it can
distribute multiple input streams (i.e. from multiple DVB-cards) to multiple
clients using the native VTP protocol (for VDR-clients), or using the HTTP
protocol supporting clients such as XINE, MPlayer and so on. With XMMS or
WinAMP, you can also listen to radio channels over a HTTP connection.
