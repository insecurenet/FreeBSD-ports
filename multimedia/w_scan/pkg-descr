[From the README:]

this is a small channel scan tool for vdr which generates ATSC, DVB-C,
DVB-S/S2 and DVB-T channels.conf files.
It's 50% "scan" from linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1.0, the differences are:

- no initial tuning data needed, because scanning without this data is exactly
  what a scan tool like this should do
- it detects automatically which DVB/ATSC card to use.
