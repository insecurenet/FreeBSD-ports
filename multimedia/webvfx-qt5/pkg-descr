WebVfx is a video effects framework that allows video effects
(filters, transitions, etc.) to be authored using web technologies
(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebGL, etc.) or with Qt Quick QML (a
declarative CSS and JavaScript like language).

WebVfx includes plugins for the MLT open source multimedia framework.
