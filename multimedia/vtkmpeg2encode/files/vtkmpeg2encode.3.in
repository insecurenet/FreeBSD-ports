.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This is the VTK MPEG2 encoder library for the Visualization Tool Kit.

vtkmpeg2encode has been removed from VTK due to patent issues with the
MPEG format.

For those who don't mind dealing with the issues related to patented code,
vtkmpeg2encode is now available as a separate download. Go to
http://www.vtk.org and click on the "Download" link and look for links to
archives of the vtkmpeg2encode source tree. It is buildable with CMake. See
the comments in vtkMPEG2Writer class documentation or in VTK's
CMakeLists.txt near the VTK_USE_MPEG2_ENCODER option for more info.

FreeBSD ports users can simply install the vtkmpeg2encode port and read
the license terms.

Those of you using vtkMPEG2Writer will have to build vtkmpeg2encode
separately and link it in to VTK to keep using it... assuming the
responsibility for using patented code properly yourselves. Otherwise, you
will have to discontinue use of the vtkMPEG2Writer class.
