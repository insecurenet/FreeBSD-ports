OpenQuicktime aims to be a portable library for handling Apple's
QuickTime(TM) popular media files on Unix-like environments. This
project was firstly designed to allow the porting of the 3ivx codec
on any Unix, but is now a completely separate and fully Open Source
project. Details:

  - OpenQuicktime library contains no embedded codecs but has a
    plugin system to dynamically load audio and video codecs.
  - OpenQuicktime contains no colorspace conversion algorithm.
  - OpenQuicktime is fully portable and fully configurable with all
    the autoconfigure and automake magic we have been able to add.
  - OpenQuicktime supports compressed headers (decoding only for the
    moment).
  - OpenQuicktime supports Quicktime Sound System version 2.
  - OpenQuicktime can support any inputs and outputs (file, HTTP,
    FTP, RTP, ...), in fact the functions used to read, write and
    seek are overloadable.
  - OpenQuicktime has an overloadable plugin mechanism. This is a
    complex feature which enables any application to use its own
    codecs instead of the OpenQuicktime ones.
