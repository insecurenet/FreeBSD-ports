[ edited excerpt from developer's README ]

The MPEG4IP project provides a standards-based system for encoding,
streaming, and playing MPEG-4 encoded audio and video. To achieve
this we've integrated a number of existing open source packages,
and also created some original code to fill in the gaps.

Please note this project is intended for developers who are interested
in MPEG-4 audio and video, and Internet streaming. It is not intended
for end-users. Please read all the legal information in the file
"COPYING"!

There is also a project web site at http://www.mpeg4ip.net/ that
has some general information on MPEG4IP.
