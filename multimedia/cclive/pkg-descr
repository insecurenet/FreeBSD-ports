cclive is a lightweight command line video extraction tool for YouTube and
other similar video websites.  It is a rewrite of the clive software in C++
with lower system footprint and fewer dependencies.  It works closely with
the quvi project to workaround the Flash technology that is being utilized
by different media hosts to deliver the content.

While being primarily a video download tool, it can also be used alongside
with some video players, e.g. mplayer, for viewing streamed videos instead
of the Adobe flash player.
