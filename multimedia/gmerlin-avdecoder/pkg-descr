Gmerlin_avdecoder is a general purpose media decoding library. It
was written as a support library for gmerlin, but it can also be
used by other applications. You don't even need gmerlin installed,
only gavl. Most of it was written completely from scratch, but the
sourcetrees of some other great software packages were used as
reference documentation. Credits go to the authors of Xine, MPlayer,
quicktime4linux and ffmpeg.

Gmerlin_avdecoder is one of the most complete general purpose media
decoding libraries. The supported formats and codecs span a wide
range of applications from consumer level (mp3, divx etc.) to high
end production formats like 32 bit PCM and some professional
uncompressed video codecs.
Using gmerlin_avdecoder in your playback for transcoding application
means rock solid media format support with an ever growing list of
supported codecs and formats.
