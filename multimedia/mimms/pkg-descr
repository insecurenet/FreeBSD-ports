MMS is a program designed to allow you to download streams using
the MMS protocol and save them to your computer, as opposed to
watching them live. Similar functionality is available in full
media player suites such as Xine and MPlayer, but MiMMS is quick
and easy to use, and for the time being, remains a useful program.
