2ManDVD is the successor of ManDVD, an application for creating video DVDs
from a wide variety of video formats.  You can add as many video clips you

converted.  It also offers possibility of extracting images, synchronize
audio and video, create a video introduction to the DVD, reduce the noise,
create subtitles, and even a menu with animation for your DVD.
