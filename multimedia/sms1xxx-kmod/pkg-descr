Native FreeBSD driver for Siano-based USB DVB devices.

This driver have been tested with the following devices :

  * Terratec Cinergy Piranha
  * Hauppauge WinTV MiniStick (HD)

However, other Siano-based USB devices should work, just give a try
(you may want to add new VIDs/PIDs to make your device detected) !
