MythTV is a "Personal Video Recorder", i.e. a computer-based video
recorder.  It supports pausing and rewinding live TV, multiple tuner
cards, hardware or software video compression, onscreen program
guides and a distributed architecture.

MythTV requires tuner drivers which support the V4L standard.
Currently no official FreeBSD driver does so, but the latest version
of a beta version of the cxm driver is available from
http://usleepless.110mb.com/pvrxxx_port-10042007.tgz.  Problems
have been reported with this port; if you use it, you should join
the FreeBSD-multimedia mailing list and report where appropriate.
