Numarray is a reimplementation of the original Python Numeric array
module that provides Python with capbilities similar to Matlab, IDL,
Octave, APL and other array-based languages. This version is still
in its early stages and is not yet the official replacement for
Numeric though we hope it will be before long. It is not fully
backwards compatible with Numeric, particularly with regard to the
C API.
