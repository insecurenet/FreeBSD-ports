The purpose of this project is to develop a free (open source),
platform independent alternative to Origin. QtiPlot is being actively
improved, all your suggestions to our "wish to" list and all your
contributions are most welcome!

Features:
 * QtiPlot is fully scriptable via Python, which gives you the
 possibility to use powerfull existing scientific tools, such as
 SciPy
 * OpenGL based 3D Plotting
 * Publication quality 2D plots
 * Easy export of plots to vector formats (EPS, PS, PDF) and
 to other various image formats (BMP, JPG, PNG, TIFF etc ...)
 * Powerful and versatile spreadsheets and calculations in column-logic
 * Easy ASCII-Import/Export of single or multiple files
 * Linear and non-linear y=f(x) curve fitting and estimation of
 statistical errors of the fit-parameters
 * Multi-peak fitting with Gaussian and Lorentzian peak profiles
 * Data analysis: statistics, sorting, FFT, data smoothing
 (Savitzky-Golay, FFT smoothing, and moving window average), data
 filtering (low/high/band pass and band block filters),
 convolution/deconvolution, correlation, interpolation, numerical
 integration/differentiation, etc...
 * Matrices optimized for 3D plotting
 * Templates support: all the settings for plots (2D/3D), tables
 and matrixes can be saved to ASCII files and restored later on for
 a fast editing process
 * Project files based on folders, a powerful project explorer with
 extensive built-in features: drag and drop, searching facilities,
 etc...
