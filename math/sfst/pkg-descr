SFST is a toolbox for the implementation of morphological analysers and other
tools which are based on finite state transducer technology.

The SFST tools comprise:
-- a compiler which translates transducer programs into minimised transducers
-- interactive and batch-mode analysis programs
-- tools for comparing and printing transducers
-- an efficient C++ transducer library

Features:
-- easy to learn for users who are familiar with grep, sed, or Perl.
-- efficient implementation in C++
-- supports
   -- a wide range of transducer operations
   -- UTF-8 character coding
   -- weighted transducers (basic functionality only)
