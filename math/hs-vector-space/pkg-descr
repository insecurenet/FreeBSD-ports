vector-space provides classes and generic operations for vector spaces
and affine spaces in Haskell. It also defines a type of infinite towers
of generalized derivatives. A generalized derivative is a linear
transformation rather than one of the common concrete representations
(scalars, vectors, matrices, etc).
