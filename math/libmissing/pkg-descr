This is a collection of stopgap replacements for standard math
functions missing from libm in various supported versions of
FreeBSD. The functions are slower than the existing libm
functions, but are more accurate than many naive replacements.
Exceptions are largely ignored.  N. Beebe's extended C version
of the ELEFUNT package is used to provide regression tests for
some of the real-valued functions.
