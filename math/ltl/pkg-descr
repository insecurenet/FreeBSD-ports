LTL is a C++ class template library for scientific computing which provides
high performance via SSE3 floating point support for vector operations.

Useful for array processing, image processing, FITS and ASCII I/O, and linear
algebra (astronomical and scientific computing, in short). LTL provides
dynamic arrays of up to 5-dimensions, subarrays and slicing, support for fixed
size vectors and matrices including basic linear algebra operations, expression
templates based evaluation, and I/O facilities for ascii and FITS format files.

Users of the boost and blitz++ library may find the cross-pollination of these
unique features to be fruitful.
