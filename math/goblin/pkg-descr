GOBLIN is a C++ class library focussed on graph optimization and network
programming problems. It deals with all of the standard graph optimization
problems discussed by textbooks and in courses on combinatorial optimization.

Today, GOBLIN provides strongly polynomial algorithms for the following graph
optimization problems:
   - Shortest paths in graphs and digraphs with negative lengths.
   - Negative cycles and minimum mean cycles.
   - Strong and 2-connected components.
   - Minimum spanning trees, arborescences and 1-trees.
   - Maximum st-flows, feasible circulations and b-flows.
   - Min-cost st-flows, b-flows and circulations.
   - Assignment problems of any kind.
   - 1-matchings, b-matchings, capacitated b-matchings, f-factors and
     degree-constrained subgraphs.
   - Directed and undirected Chinese postman problems, T-joins.

The library also includes methods for NP-hard problems, namely TSP, ATSP,
stable sets and graph colouring.
