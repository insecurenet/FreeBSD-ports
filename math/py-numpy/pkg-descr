The fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python is
called NumPy.  This package contains:

    * a powerful N-dimensional array object
    * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    * basic linear algebra functions
    * basic Fourier transforms
    * sophisticated random number capabilities
    * tools for integrating Fortran code.

NumPy derives from the old Numeric code base and can be used as a
replacement for Numeric.   It also adds the features introduced by numarray
and can also be used to replace numarray.

Note:	Development for Numeric has ceased, and users should transisition to
	NumPy as quickly as possible.
