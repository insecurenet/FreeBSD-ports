.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an open source, freely available
software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and
visualization used by thousands of researchers and developers around the
world. VTK consists of a C++ class library, and several interpreted
interface layers including Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. Professional support
and products for VTK are provided by Kitware, Inc. VTK supports a wide
variety of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor,
texture, and volumetric methods; and advanced modeling techniques such as
implicit modelling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting,
contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. In addition, dozens of imaging
algorithms have been directly integrated to allow the user to mix 2D
imaging / 3D graphics algorithms and data. The design and implementation
of the library has been strongly influenced by object-oriented principles.
VTK has been installed and tested on nearly every Unix-based platform, PCs
(Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP), and Mac OSX Jaguar or later.

VTK is far too extensive to document properly with man pages.  Please visit
http://vtk.org for full documentation.
