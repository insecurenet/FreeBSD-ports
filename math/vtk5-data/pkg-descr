This port contains data and baseline images for VTK regression testing
and other VTK examples. The Data directory are data files of various
types. This includes polygonal data, images, volumes, structured grids,
rectilinear grids, and multi-variate data.
The Baseline are the testing images. These are used in testing to compare
a valid image against a generated image. If a difference between the two
images is found, then the test is considered to have failed.
