    **********************************************************************

    LLNL XFTP, an OSF/Motif-based FTP client, enables you to graphically
    transfer files and perform various directory manipulation commands,
    both locally and remotely.  Two especially notable features are the
        ability to (1) perform "third-party" (i.e., remote-to-remote) file
    transfers, and (2) transfer or delete entire directory substructures.
    LLNL XFTP has many features, is configurable, and has an intuitive
    user interface.

    LLNL XFTP is a precursor to LLNL XDIR, a much more sophisticated
    graphical FTP client.  LLNL XDIR features drag-and-drop file transfer,
    powerful directory browsing, and multihost searching.  Unless you
    would prefer LLNL XFTP's compact interface over LLNL XDIR's multiwindow
    approach, we recommend that you use LLNL XDIR.
