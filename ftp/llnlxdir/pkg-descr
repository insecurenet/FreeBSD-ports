                  LLNL XDIR Version 2.0,  October 23, 1995

    LLNL XDIR, an OSF/Motif-based FTP client, provides a graphical user
    interface for drag-and-drop file transfer.  LLNL XDIR simultaneously
    displays any number of directories for any number of hosts, with each
    directory being displayed in its own window.  LLNL XDIR supports
    powerful directory browsing capability, including iconic and
    hierarchical views.  One of LLNL XDIR's most powerful features is its
    ability to search directory structures (even across multiple hosts)
    for entry names that match a specified pattern.

    LLNL XDIR is meant to be the successor to LLNL XFTP, another graphical
    FTP client.  LLNL XDIR is considerably more sophisticated than LLNL
    XFTP, and has all of its functionality.

    LLNL XDIR is a component of the Intelligent Archive, which is currently
    under development at LLNL.

    LLNL XDIR was written by Neale Smith of the Lawrence Livermore National
    Laboratory, which is operated by the University of California.
