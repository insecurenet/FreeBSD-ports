Gwyddion is a modular SPM (Scanning Probe Microsopy) data visualization
and analysis tool written with Gtk+.

It can be used for all most frequently used data processing operations
including: leveling, false color plotting, shading, filtering,
denoising, data editing, integral transforms, grain analysis, profile
extraction, fractal analysis, and many more. The program is primarily
focused on SPM data analysis (e.g. data obtained from AFM, STM, NSOM,
and similar microscopes). However, it can also be used for analysis of
SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) data or any other 2D data.
