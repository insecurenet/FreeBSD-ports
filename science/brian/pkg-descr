Brian is a simulator for spiking neural networks available on almost all
platforms. The motivation for this project is that a simulator should
not only save the time of processors, but also the time of scientists.

Brian is easy to learn and use, highly flexible and easily extensible.
The Brian package itself and simulations using it are all written in
the Python programming language, which is an easy, concise and highly
developed language with many advanced features and development tools,
excellent documentation and a large community of users providing support
and extension packages.
