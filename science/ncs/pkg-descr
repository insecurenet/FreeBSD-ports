Code Saturne is a system designed to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the
cases of 2D, 2D axisymmetric or 3D flows. Its main module is designed for the
simulation of flows which may be steady or unsteady, laminar or turbulent,
incompressible or potentially dilatable, isothermal or not.
Scalars and turbulent fluctuations of scalars can be taken into account. The
code includes specific modules, referred to as "specific physics", for the
treatment of lagrangian particle tracking, semi-transparent radiative transfer,
gas combustion, pulverised coal combustion, electricity effects (Joule effect
and electric arcs) and compressible flows. The code also includes an engineering
module, Matisse, for the simulation of nuclear waste surface storage.

Code_Saturne relies on a finite volume discretisation and allows the use of
various mesh types which may be hybrid (containing several kinds of elements)
and may have structural non-conformities (hanging nodes).

NCS means "Noyau Code Saturne", i.e. "Code Saturne Kernel". This is the
numerical solver.
