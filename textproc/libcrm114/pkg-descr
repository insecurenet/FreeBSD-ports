This is the callable library version of CRM114. It has most of the classifiers
as the standalone language. This version is LGPLed (Library GPL) so you can
link it with your own code, whether open-source or proprietary.
You still need TRE. Note that with improvements come costs:
libcrm114 classifiers are NOT compatible with standalone CRM114 class files.
