Python connector for ElasticSearch - the pythonic way to use ElasticSearch

We are working to provide full support to ElasticSearch 1.x (check the
develop branch: we are using the git-flow workflow) that'll have:

* connection based on Official ElasticSearch client ??
* full support to ElasticSearch 1.x (removed old support due incompatibility
* with old version of ES)
* migration from multi_field to >field>.fields
* refactory of old code to be more pythonic
* performance improvements
