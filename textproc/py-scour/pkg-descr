Scour is a Python tool that takes an SVG file and produces a cleaner
and more concise file. It is intended to be used after exporting to
SVG with a GUI editor, such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.

Scour was originally developed by Jeff "codedread" Schiller and Louis
Simard. Development is now maintained by Tobias "oberstet" Oberstein.
