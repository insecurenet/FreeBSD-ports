ASV is a popular Python module to parse or write simple text file formats
such as comma-separated values (CSV), tab-separated values (TSV) and
colon-separated values.  It can easily be extended to cope with other
related file formats.

This port installs both a Python module ("ASV"), and an executable
command-line script ("asv").

This release of ASV requires Python 2.0 or later, and is still to be regarded
as a beta version.
