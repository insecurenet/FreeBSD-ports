This is the original diff program from 2.11BSD.  It works better
with very large files on systems with datasize limits.

Default FreeBSD limits datasize to 524288 kbytes.  This means that
GNU diff processes that require more than this much ram will fail.
The 2.11BSD diff did not load the files in core and could operate
on considerably less ram.
