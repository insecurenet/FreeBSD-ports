The doclifter program translates documents written in troff macros to DocBook.

Lifting documents from presentation level to semantic level is hard, and
a really good job requires human polishing.  This tool aims to do everything
that can be mechanized, and to preserve any troff-level information that might
have structural implications in XML comments.

This tool does some of the hard parts, but not all.  TBL tables are translated
into DocBook table markup, but EQN and PIC are not translated (yet).
