WORDS is a free Latin-English dictionary program which takes keyboard
input or a file of Latin text lines and provides an analysis/morphology
(declension, conjugation, case, tense, etc.) of each word individually,
the dictionary form, and the translation (meaning).

The dictionary contains over 30000 entries and, through additional word
construction with hundreds of prefixes and suffixes, may generate more,
leading to many hundreds of thousands of 'words' that can be formed by
declension and conjugation. Present emphisis is on classical Latin and
late Latin, but medieval Latin entries are increasing. WORDS provides a
tool to help in translations for the Latin student and a memory jog for
researchers.
