Used in its basic form, this module provides an interface for generating
basic HTML form elements much like HTML::StickyForms does. The main
difference is HTML::SuperForm returns HTML::SuperForm::Field objects
rather than plain HTML.  This allows for more flexibilty when generating
forms for a complex application.

To get the most out of this module, use it as a base (Super) class for
your own form object which generates your own custom fields. If you
don't use it this way, I guess there's really nothing Super about it.
Example are shown later in the document.

The interface was designed with mod_perl and the Template Toolkit in
mind, but it works equally well in any cgi environment.
