This is yet another library for template-based text generation.

Template-based text generation is a way to separate program code and
data, so non-programmer can control final result (like HTML) as desired
without tweaking the program code itself. By doing so, jobs like website
maintenance is much easier because you can leave program code unchanged
even if page redesign was needed.

The idea is simple. Whenever a block of text surrounded by '<%' and '%>'
(or any pair of delimiters you specify) is found, it will be taken as
Perl expression, and will be replaced by its evaluated result.

Major goal of this library is simplicity and speed. While there're many
modules for template processing, this module has near raw Perl-code
(i.e., "s|xxx|xxx|ge") speed, while providing simple-to-use objective
interface.
