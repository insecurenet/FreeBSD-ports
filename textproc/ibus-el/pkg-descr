ibus.el is IBus client for GNU Emacs.  ibus.el provides ibus-mode
minor mode, which allows users on-the-spot style input with IBus on
Emacs.  The input statuses are individually kept for each buffer, and
prefix-keys such as C-x and C-c can be used even if IBus is active.
So you can input various languages fast and comfortably.
