Text::Tmpl is a module for very fast templating. There are dozens of
templating modules on CPAN, each only a tiny bit different from the
others. This one is no different - what sets it aside is speed. The
entire module is implemented as a C library, with only a thin XS/Perl
layer to make the calls available from Perl. The same templates, then,
can be used from either Perl or C/C++ programs.

This was originally designed to completely isolate HTML programmers from
module/CGI programmers, or at least completely separate logic from
content in dynamic web applications. It is syntactically based on a
similar system written by a friend of mine, Neil Mix, which was
proprietary and exclusively written in Perl. It shares no code in common
with this system, or any other.
