Contains renderers and parsers for both XML and HTML 5 document fragments,
which share data structures so that it's easy to work with both. Document
fragments are bits of documents, which are not constrained by some of the
high-level structure rules (in particular, they may contain more than one
root element). Note that this is not a compliant HTML 5 parser. Rather,
it is a parser for HTML 5 compliant documents. It does not implement the
HTML 5 parsing algorithm, and should generally be expected to perform
correctly only on documents that you trust to conform to HTML 5. This is
not a suitable library for implementing web crawlers or other software
that will be exposed to documents from outside sources. The result is also
not the HTML 5 node structure, but rather something closer to the physical
structure. For example, omitted start tags are not inserted (and so, their
corresponding end tags must also be omitted).
