From the README:
                A Tcl interface to expat.

This package provides a Tcl interface to James Clark's expat library.
It creates a Tcl package, called "expat", which defines a single
new Tcl command "expat".

This port ignores the old expat distribution bundled with the software
and links the library against the latest installed by the expat2 port.
