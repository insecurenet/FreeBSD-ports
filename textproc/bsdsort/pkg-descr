This a BSD-licensed version of the well-known sort utility that has been
rewritten from scratch by Gabor Kovesdan <gabor@FreeBSD.org> and later
developed by Oleg Moskalenko <oleg.moskalenko@citrix.com>.  This
implementation is meant to be a replacement of GNU sort for FreeBSD.
Currently, it seems to be quite feature-complete but performance needs
some improvements.
