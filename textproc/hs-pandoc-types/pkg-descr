This package contains definitions for the 'Pandoc' data structure, which is
used by pandoc to represent structured documents.  These definitions used to
live in the pandoc package, but starting with pandoc 1.7, they have been
split off, so that other packages can use them without drawing in all of
pandoc's dependencies, and pandoc itself can depend on packages (like
citeproc-hs) that use them.
