An integrated solution for XML-based publishing in print and web.
It is specifically targeted at producing technical documentation
in the field of computer science.

Documents are written in an XML-based markup language and translated
to different formats with XSL-transformations. At this time, eCromedos
supports the target formats XHTML and LATEX. Where LATEX output can be
further processed into high-quality printable formats by use of the
TEX typesetting system (http://www.ctan.org).
