This program has three modes of operation:
- First, is ** EXPLOSION **, or the expanding of a .LIT file into an
  OEBPS compliant package.
- Second, is the DOWNCONVERTING of a .LIT file down to "Sealed",
  or DRM1 format for reading on handheld devices.
- Third, is the INSCRIBING of a .LIT file which allows you to label
  your ebooks.

DRM5 is supported if you have a "keys.txt" file that contains
the private key(s) for your passport(s) in either the CLIT program
directory or the current directory.

This is a tool for **YOUR OWN FAIR USE** and not for stealing
other people's ebooks.

Please do not use this program to distrbute illegal copies of ebooks.
        ... that would make Baby Jesus sad.
