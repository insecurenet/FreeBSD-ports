String::Strip is an XS extension that implements four white space
removal routines: StripSpace (remove all white space), StripLSpace
(strip leading white space), StripTSpace (strip trailing white space),
and StripLTSpace (strip leading and trailing white space). All four of
these routines work directly on the input argument, rather than passing
back a result. The routines tend to be roughly 30% faster than
equivalent function regex code.
