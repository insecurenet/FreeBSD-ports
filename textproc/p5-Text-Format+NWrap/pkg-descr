The format routine will format under all circumstances even if the width
isn't enough to contain the longest words. Text::Wrap will die under
these circumstances, although I am told this is fixed. If columns is set
to a small number and words are longer than that and the leading
'whitespace' than there will be a single word on each line. This will
let you make a simple word list which could be indented or right
aligned.

This port is a superset of p5-Text-Format -- it includes the Text::NWrap
module.
