This is the template engine for the Ada Web Server.  It is modular and
therefore can be split out of AWS and used on its own.

As it was designed for generating web pages, it's function is to parse
a page template and replace tokens with specified values.  This template
engine is amazingly fast due to its concurrent cached compiled templates
support.
