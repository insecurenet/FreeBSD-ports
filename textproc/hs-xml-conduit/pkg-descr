This package provides parsing and rendering functions for XML.  It is
based on the datatypes found in the xml-types package.  This package is
broken up into the following modules:

 * Text.XML: DOM-based parsing and rendering.  This is the most commonly
   used module.

 * Text.XML.Cursor: A wrapper around Text.XML which allows bidirectional
   traversing of the DOM, similar to XPath.

 * Text.XML.Unresolved: A slight modification to Text.XML which does not
   require all entities to be resolved at parsing.  The datatypes are
   slightly more complicated here, and therefore this module is only
   recommended when you need to deal directly with raw entities.

 * Text.XML.Stream.Parse: Streaming parser, including some streaming
   parser combinators.

 * Text.XML.Stream.Render: Streaming renderer.
