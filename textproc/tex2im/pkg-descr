Tex2im is a simple tool that converts LaTeX formulas into high resolution
pixmap graphics for inclusion in text processors or presentations. I
encountered the problem that the formulas generated by the editors of common
office packages usually were the ugliest part of my scientific presentations;
on the other hand I didn't want to use latex for my transparencies. On the
latex side I'm aware of the slitex and foiltex packages, nevertheless I
consider them to be masochistic. EPS import can be nice, but commonly you get
either display or printing problems. Also, often its nice just to copy
formulas out of you latex documents.
