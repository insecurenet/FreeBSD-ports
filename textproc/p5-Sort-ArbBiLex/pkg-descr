Writing systems for different languages usually have specific sort
orders for the glyphs (characters, or clusters of characters) that each
writing system uses. For well-known national languages, these different
sort orders (or someone's idea of them) are formalized in the locale for
each such language, on operating system flavors that support locales.
However, there are problems with locales; cf. the perllocale manpage.

This module is meant to provide an alternative to locale-based sorting.
