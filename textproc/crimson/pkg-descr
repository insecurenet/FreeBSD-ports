This version of Crimson supports the Java API for XML Processing
(JAXP) version 1.1 specification by providing implementations for the
following package hierarchies: javax.xml.parsers, org.w3c.dom,
org.xml.sax.*. Note that the javax.xml.transform hierarchy is NOT
supported. One known implementation of the javax.xml.transform
hierarchy is Xalan 2, which is available as a separate port in
java/xalan.
