The ffmpeg-php is an extension for PHP that adds an easy to use, object-oriented
API for accessing and retrieving information from video and audio files. It has
methods for returning frames from movie files as images that can be manipulated
using PHP's image functions. This works well for automatically creating
thumbnail images from movies. ffmpeg-php is also useful for reporting the
duration and bitrate of audio files (mp3, wma...).

The ffmpeg-php can access many of the video formats supported by ffmpeg (mov,
avi, mpg, wmv...)
