cthumb - a themable web picture album generator

cthumb is a command-line program that allows you to create an web
picture album, with an index and several pages, each with thumbnails of
your pictures. It optionally generates otherwise identical pages but in
several languages, simultaneously. It automatically generates thumbnails
of the pictures. It attempts to be nice in the look of the pages it
generates.

It is geared towards people that have ton of digital images that need to
be labeled, grouped, captioned and sorted out. All you need is the
pictures and a text editor to put all the captions for the picture in a
simple "album" textfile.
