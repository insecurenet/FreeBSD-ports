This is the PHP extension of the Puzzle library, which is designed to
quickly find visually similar images (GIF, PNG, JPG), even if they have been
resized, recompressed, recolored or slightly modified.
The library is free, lightweight yet very fast, configurable, easy to use
and it has been designed with security in mind.
