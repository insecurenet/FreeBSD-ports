This port installs section 3 manpages for the OpenGL 3d graphics API so
that they are directly accessable from the man(1) command. Especially
useful for the graphics/Mesa port/package.

Included OpenGL related libraries: gl, glx, glu, gle, glut.

gl, glx and glu are taken from ftp.sgi.com. They carried no version
information. Stored in the same directory at the time I grabbed them
was the OpenGL spec 1.2.1, which may or may not indicate the state of
the manpages. :-/

The gl, glx and glu manpages are unusable when just unpacking them. I
repackaged them so that
- the file name actually is the name of the function, including
  gl... etc prefixes and respecting case.
- all filenames end in *.3
- hard links are created so that the man command works for all
  functions in a manpage, not just the first one.

gle and glut are taken from the glut-3.7 distribution (where the
Webpage says it is beta, but the distfile name does not). These are
unchanged, but there are currently no hardlinks to secondary functions
names.
