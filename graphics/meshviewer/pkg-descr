The Mesh Viewer is an easy to use lightweight application to display
triangular meshes from a variety of file formats. It uses the OpenGL API
to render the models. The program was born under the need for quickly
displaying reconstructed triangulated meshes. The Mesh Viewer based on
an idea and an early elementary implementation from Craig Robertson. The
current version was developed by Helmut Cantzler. Triangular meshes can
be displayed texture mapped (optional with bilinear filtering), solid or
as a skeleton (full or just the front lines). The surface normals of the
triangles can be displayed optionally.

Features (from a different data file) like edges and points can be
displayed into the mesh. Loaded models can be rotated, translated and
scaled (all done with the mouse). The model is lighted by multiple light
sources. Viewpoints can be saved. Screenshots of the model can be taken (as
BMP, JPEG, PNG and so on).
