A WPVS is a web service which is able to generate perspective terrain
views, e.g. images of a certain terrain/area (possibly containing three
dimensional objects, e.g. building or trees) rendered from a requested
viewpoint. For this purposes the WPVS needs to process and render
different kinds of geospatial data which is retrieved from different
pre-configured datasets. These datasets can be remote OGC web services
or locally installed deegree 2 web services.
