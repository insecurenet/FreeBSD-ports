jpg2pdf is a program to convert one or more JPG images into a
single PDF or PostScript file.

Compared to other similar programs, the main advantage of jpg2pdf
is that it is very small, fast and entirely written in C.

It works by simply wrapping the JPG data with appropriate PDF or PS
glue so there is no image conversion involved.
