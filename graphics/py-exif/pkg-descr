Pyexif is a Python library and associated command line tool to extract EXIF
format metadata from the headers of JPEG and TIFF image files.  EXIF
information is typically included in images created using digital imaging
devices such as digital cameras and digital film scanners.

Currently, pyexif provides the following functionality:
- Parse EXIF headers in JPEG files.
- Parse EXIF headers in TIFF files.
- Support for camera-specific MakerNote tags (e.g. Nikon, Canon, etc.).
- Provide a simple cmdline interfaces to format the data in human-readable
  format.
