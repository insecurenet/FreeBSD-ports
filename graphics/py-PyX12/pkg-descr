PyX is a Python package for the creation of encapsulated PostScript figures.
It provides both an abstraction of PostScript and a TeX/LaTeX interface.
Complex tasks like 2d and 3d plots in publication-ready quality are built out
of these primitives.

Features
   * PostScript output for device independent, free scalable figures
   * seamless TeX/LaTeX integration
   * full access to PostScript features like paths, linestyles, fill patterns,
     transformations, clipping, etc.
   * advanced geometric operations on paths like intersections, transformations,
     splitting, etc.
   * sophisticated graph generation: modular design, pluggable axes, axes
     partitioning based on rational number arithmetics, flexible graph styles,
     etc.
