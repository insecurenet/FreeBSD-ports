The gif2png program converts files from the obsolescent Graphic
Interchange Format to Portable Network Graphics. The conversion
preserves all graphic information, including transparency, perfectly.
The gif2png program can even recover data from corrupted GIFs.

The distribution also includes a Python script, web2png, that will
convert entire web hierarchies (images and HTML or PHP pages). The
script requires Python 1.5.2.
