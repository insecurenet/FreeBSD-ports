Ayam is a free 3D modeling environment for the RenderMan Interface
(formerly known as "The Mops"). Ayam is primarily aimed at the
platforms BMRT (Blue Moon Rendering Tools, a RenderMan compliant
renderer by Larry Gritz (Exluna) runs on. As BMRT are available
in FreeBSD only as Linux binaries, Ayam will use graphics/aqsis as
a primary renderer.
