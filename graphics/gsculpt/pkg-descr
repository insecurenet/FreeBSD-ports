gSculpt is an open source, procedural subdivision modeller. It has a
comprehensive set of polygon modelling tools, including most of those
found in Wings 3D, and more.

Workflow and speed of use are important design goals in the
development of gSculpt. Pre-selection highlighting throughout the
program, and keyboard short cuts ensure that the workflow is fast and
efficient, while providing access to a powerful procedural system
which allows mistakes to be rectified easily.

Its procedural modelling system makes it an excellent choice for
making modelling tutorials, as the steps required to build the model
from the beginning are displayed to the user in a list. This list can
be navigated easily, allowing a user to view the process one step at a
time, at their own pace, while being able too look at the model from
all angles as they go.

gSculpt can import and export Wavefront Object (.obj) model files.
