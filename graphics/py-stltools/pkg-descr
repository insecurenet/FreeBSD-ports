The modules in the stltools package can read and write STL files, perform 3D
coordinate transforms and projections. These modules are used by the following
provided scripts;

stl2pov: Converts the STL model to a mesh usable with the POV-ray raytracer.
stl2ps:  Creates a view of the STL model in scalable PostScript.
stl2pdf: Creates a view of the STL model as a PDF. Requires graphics/py-cairo.
stlinfo: Either displays some information about a STL file or prints it in
         text format.
