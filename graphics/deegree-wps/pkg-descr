Deegree's WPS is able to process Feature Collections based on arbitrary
processes. OGC's WPS (Schut & Whiteside 2005) specification describes
WPS as follows: "WPS defines a standardized interface that facilitates
the publishing of geospatial processes, and the discovery of and binding
to those processes by clients. "Processes" include any algorithm,
calculation or model that operates on spatially referenced data.
"Publishing" means making available machine-readable binding
information as well as human-readable metadata that allows service
discovery and use."
