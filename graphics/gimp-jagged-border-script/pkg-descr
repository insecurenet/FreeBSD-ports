[ edited excerpt from www site ]

GIMP plugin that creates a white (or black) border around an image
that merges in with the image so that on a larger white (or black)
background, the image appears to have a ragged border.

This is similar to the GIMP's Fuzzy Border, but it adapts its
jaggedness to the image. (Also unlike Fuzzy Border, it is deterministic,
it does not depend on random number seeds.)

The plugin can be found under "Filters > theilr > jagged Border"
