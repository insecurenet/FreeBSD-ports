deegree's Web Coverage Service (WCS) is able to read coverages from
different storage formats and deliver it to any client that is able to
perform an according HTTP GET or POST request. At the moment supported
formats are limited to several raster data formats; but in general a
coverage has not to be a raster dataset at all.
