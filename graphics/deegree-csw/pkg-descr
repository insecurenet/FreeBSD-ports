Deegree is a Java Framework offering the main building blocks for
Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). Its entire architecture is
developed using standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and
ISO Technical Committee 211-Geographic information/Geoinformatics
(ISO/TC 211). deegree encompasses OGC Web Services as well as clients.
deegree is Free Software protected by the GNU Lesser General Public
License (GNU LGPL) and is accessible at http://www.deegree.org.

Deegree's Web Catalogue Service implementation (Catalogue Service - Web
profile, therefore CS-W) is able to serve different metadata formats in
parallel based on the same physical datastore. This is possible because
deegree CS-W uses XSLT processing to transform requests as well as
responses into the desired format. deegree CS-W does not contain its a
data access modul of its own. It uses an OGC WFS (at the moment limited
to deegree WFS) as datasource. So in future it will be possible to use
deegree CS-W on top of any other OGC compliant WFS to offer catalogue
functionalities.
