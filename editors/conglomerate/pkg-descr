Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor, aimed at providing
a comfortable DocBook editor for the masses that's nicely integrated
into GNOME.

Conglomerate is still fairly unstable when doing editing work,
and will crash from time to time. However, it is becoming usable
for viewing DocBook and other XML formats, for creating new documents,
and making simple changes to existing documents.
