beav (Binary Editor And Viewer) is an editor for binary files
containing arbitrary data. With beav, you can edit a file in HEX,
ASCII, EBCDIC, OCTAL, DECIMAL, and BINARY. You can display but not
edit data in FLOAT mode. You can search or search and replace in
any of these modes. Data can be displayed in BYTE, WORD, or DOUBLE
WORD formats. While displaying WORDS or DOUBLE WORDS the data can
be displayed in INTEL's or MOTOROLA's byte ordering. Data of any
length can be inserted at any point in the file. The source of this
data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file. Any data that
is being displayed can be sent to a printer in the displayed format.
Files that are bigger than memory can be handled.
