With the goal of staying out of your way while writing creatively, PyRoom has a
very specialized featureset. In fact, most features are hidden from your main
interface, not cluttering your workspace with buttons and menus and statistics.

Features of PyRoom:
 * no visual clutter
 * work on multiple documents at once (main text, outline, etc)
 * control PyRoom via keyboard shortcuts
 * autosave your work
 * check wordcounts on keypress
 * choose from preconfigured designs or create your own color scheme
 * further customize visual appearance and whitespace (line spacing, border,
   padding...)
