Padre - Perl Application Development and Refactoring Environment

Padre is an Perl IDE that is simple to use for new Perl programmers
but also supports large multi-lingual and multi-technology projects.

Padre is written in Perl, runs on all three major desktop platforms (Windows,
Mac OS X and Unix/GTK), and is distributed under the perl license.

WARNING: Padre requires Perl with thread support built-in !
