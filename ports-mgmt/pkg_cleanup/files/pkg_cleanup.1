.TH PKG_CLEANUP 1 "October 2007" FreeBSD
.SH NAME
pkg_cleanup \- deinstall 'leaf' packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pkg_cleanup
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pkg_rmleaves
Finds packages that are not required by any other installed
package and lets you decide (in a dialog interface) for each one
if you want to delete it. The package comment is shown at the top
of the screen and F1 will display the full package description.
.P Once the packages marked for removal have been deleted,
you'll be asked if you want to do another run (to see packages that have
become 'leaves' now because you've deinstalled the package(s) that
depended on them). In every run you will be shown only packages that you
haven't marked for keeping, yet.
.P This program was heavily based on the pkg_rmleaves script. The only
functional difference is that this version shows the package comment and
F1 will show the package description.
.SH BUGS
pkg_cleanup does not display the help line for the first selected
package
