pkg_cleanup finds packages that are not requested by any other installed
package and lets you decide for each one if you want to keep it or delete it.
It also allows viewing the package comment and description.

This program is essentially a clone of pkg_rmleaves except that it shows
the comment and description of packages and does not support GUI dialog(1)
implementations.
