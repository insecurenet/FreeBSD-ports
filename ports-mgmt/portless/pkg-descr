The portless utility is a small shell script which lets FreeBSD users
quickly browse port descriptions given the port's name or a
glob. Basically to view the descriptions of GCC (related) ports you
simply type
	portless gcc\*
and it will display all descriptions of the gcc* ports.
There are options to display the port's postinstall message or
Makefile too. A manpage is included.
