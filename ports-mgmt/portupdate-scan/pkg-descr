portupdate-scan simplifies dealing with /usr/ports/UPDATING when you have so
many ports installed that it is difficult to know which sections are relevant.

It reads /usr/ports/UPDATING, attempting for each block to determine whether
the affected ports are installed. It omits blocks that do not apply.
It handles wildcards and other special cases, however it cannot handle
all variants of phrases used on the AFFECTS: line.
In uncertain cases, it errs on the side of reporting.
