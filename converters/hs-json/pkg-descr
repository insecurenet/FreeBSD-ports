JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse
and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming
Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. This library
provides a parser and pretty printer for converting between Haskell values
and JSON.
