Usage instructions for applications calling the sqlite3 API functions:

  In your application, call sqlite3_enable_load_extension(db,1) to
  allow loading external libraries.  Then load the library
  %%LIBFILE%% using sqlite3_load_extension; the third argument
  should be 0. See http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=LoadableExtensions.
  Select statements may now use these functions, as in:

  SELECT cos(radians(inclination)) FROM satsum WHERE satnum = 25544;


Usage instructions for the sqlite3 program:

  If the program is built so that loading extensions is permitted,
  the following will work:

  sqlite> SELECT load_extension('%%LIBFILE%%');
  sqlite> select cos(radians(45));
  0.707106781186548

  Note: Loading extensions is by default prohibited as a
  security measure; see "Security Considerations" in
  http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=LoadableExtensions.

  If the sqlite3 program and library are built this
  way, you cannot use these functions from the program, you
  must write your own program using the sqlite3 API, and call
  sqlite3_enable_load_extension as described above, or else
  rebuilt the sqlite3 program to allow loadable extensions.
