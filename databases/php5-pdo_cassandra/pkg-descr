PDO driver for Apache Cassandra

Cassandra is a highly scalable, eventually consistent, distributed,
structured key-value store. Cassandra brings together the distributed
systems technologies from Dynamo and the data model from Google's
BigTable. Like Dynamo, Cassandra is eventually consistent. Like
BigTable, Cassandra provides a ColumnFamily-based data model richer
than typical key/value systems.
