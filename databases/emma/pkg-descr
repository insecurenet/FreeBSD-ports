Emma is a graphical toolkit for MySQL database developers and administrators.
It provides dialogs to create or modify MySQL databases, tables and
associated indexes.  It has a built-in syntax highlighting SQL editor with
table- and fieldname tab-completion and automatic SQL statement formatting.
The results of an executed query are displayed in a resultset where the record-
data can be edited by the user, if the SQL statement allows for it. The SQL
editor and resultset-view are grouped in tabs. Results can be exported to CSV
files. Multiple simultaneously opened MySQL connections are possible.
