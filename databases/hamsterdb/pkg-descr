hamsterdb is a lightweight embedded database engine. It is
in development for more than three years and concentrates
on ease of use, high performance, stability and portability.

The hamsterdb API is simple and self-documenting. The interface
is similar to other widely-used database engines. Fast algorithms
and data structures guarantee high performance for all scenarios.
Hamsterdb has hundreds of unittests with a test coverage of over
90%. Each release is tested with thousands of acceptance tests in
many different configurations, tested on up to six different
hardware architectures and operating systems. Written in plain
ANSI-C, hamsterdb runs on many architectures: Intel-compatible
(x86, x64), PowerPC, SPARC, ARM, RISC and others. Tested operating
systems include Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Windows CE, Linux,
SunOS and other Unices.
