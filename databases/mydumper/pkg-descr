== What is mydumper? Why? ==

* Parallelism (hence, speed) and performance (avoids expensive character set
  conversion routines, efficient code overall)
* Easier to manage output (separate files for tables, dump metadata, etc, easy
  to view/parse data)
* Consistency - maintains snapshot across all threads, provides accurate master
  and slave log positions, etc
* Manageability - supports PCRE for specifying database and tables inclusions
  and exclusions
