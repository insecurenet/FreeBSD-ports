JasperReports is a powerful open source Java reporting tool that has the
ability to deliver rich content onto the screen, to the printer or into
PDF, HTML, XLS, CSV and XML files.

It is entirely written in Java and can be used in a variety of Java enabled
applications, including J2EE or Web applications, to generate dynamic content.

Its main purpose is to help creating page oriented, ready to print documents in
a simple and flexible manner.

If you need a GUI, please see the port devel/ireport.
