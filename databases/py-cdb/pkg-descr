python-cdb is D. J. Bernstein's constant database library adapted as a
python extension module.

cdb files are mappings of keys to values, designed for wickedly fast
lookups and atomic updates.  This module mimics the normal cdb
utilities (cdb(get|dump|make)) via convenient high-level Python
objects.
