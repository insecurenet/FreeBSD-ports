The MySQL-ODBC SDK enables you to make MySQL-specific applications
database-independent without wholesale re-writes of your application code.
Thus, applications that are written directly to the MySQL call level interface
now end up being database independent via iODBC (or unixODBC), and usable
against any ODBC accessible database (including MySQL).
