APQ is a database interface library written in Ada95.  This is the base
library, but it is not useful without a driver.  There are three drivers
available for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and ODBC in separate ports.

Some features:
  * Thick binding
  * Strong typing support
  * Full BLOB support (PGSQL)
  * High performance BLOB I/O via streams
  * Full support for NULL Values
  * Fully portable (database neutral) code possible
  * Four levels of debug tracing
