Allows include files to be used in shells the same way they are with C.
The file with the include code needs to be included. This is done by
figuring out were it is located using which.  . `which sh-include` will
take care of it for sh.

sh example...
. `which sh-include`
include fileGetLine
line=`fileGetLine /etc/group 4`
