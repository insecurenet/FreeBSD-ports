xpbiff:  fancy biff program under X11 environment, supporting Japanese MIME
extensions

	This port supports Japanese strings in the From and Subject fields.
Please set the LANG enviroment variable to ja_JP.EUC or ja_JP.SJIS by doing:
		setenv LANG ja_JP.EUC
		or
		setenv LANG ja_JP.SJIS
	There is experimental support for Sun audio.  This port also supports
XPM bitmap files.

known problem:
	(1) HANKAKU-KANA with ja_JP.EUC
	   Xpbiff dumps core, because code conversion routines jis2euc()
	assumes "the conversion does not makes the string longer".   But
	when converting so-called 'hankaku-kana', this assumption breaks.

	This problem is only with ja_JP.EUC.
	If you use with ja_JP.SJIS, this problem is not occure.

Thank you.
