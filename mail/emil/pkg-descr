Emil is a filter for converting Internet Messages. It supports
three basic formats: MIME, SUN Mailtool and RFC822. It can be
used with sendmail, as a loopback mailer, as a prefilter or
backend program with a mail client program, or as a plain
filter. Conversion can be configured by a configuration file,
emil.cf, using sender, recipient and recipient host as input
parameters or by command line arguments.

Emil is able to:
- convert the format, headers and structure, between messages of type
	MIME, Sun Mailtool and RFC822.
- convert the encoding of binary data between Base64, BinHex and Uuencode.
- convert the encoding of text to and from the MIME encoding Quoted-Printable.
- convert character set of text between the character sets made
	available by Keld J. Simonsens strncnv package.
- do one-way conversions of 8bit text to the Swedish national variant of
	ISO-646 or to US-ASCII.
- convert to and from RFC1522 format headers.
