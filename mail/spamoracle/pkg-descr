SpamOracle, a.k.a. "Saint Peter", is a tool to help detect and
filter away "spam" (unsolicited commercial e-mail).  It proceeds
by statistical analysis of the words that appear in the e-mail,
comparing the frequencies of words with those found in a user-provided
corpus of known spam and known legitimate e-mail.  The classification
algorithm is based on Bayes' formula, and is described in Paul
Graham's paper, A plan for spam.

This program is designed to work in conjunction with procmail.  The
result of the analysis is output as an additional message header
X-Spam:, followed by yes, no or unknown, plus additional details.
A procmail rule can then test this X-Spam: header and deliver the
e-mail to the appropriate mailbox.
