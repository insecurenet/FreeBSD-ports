This software block SMTP sessions used by e-mail worms and viruses on
the NA(P)T router. It depends on netfilter framework of Linux, or ipfw
on FreeBSD.

It acts like proxy, intercepting outgoing SMTP connections and scanning
session data on-the-fly. When messages is infected, the SMTP session is
terminated. It's to be used (mostly) by ISPs, so they can eliminate
infected hosts from their net work, and (preferably) educate their users.
