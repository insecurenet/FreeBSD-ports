OfflineIMAP synchronizes emails between two repositories,
so that you can read the same mailbox from multiple computers.
It supports IMAP as REMOTE repository and Maildir/IMAP
as LOCAL repository.

OfflineIMAP is also useful if you want to use a mail reader
that does not have IMAP support, has poor IMAP support,
or does not provide disconnected operation.
