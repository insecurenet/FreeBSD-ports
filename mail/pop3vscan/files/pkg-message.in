By default, POP3VScan is configured to work with McAfee UVSCAN.
Please copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/pop3vscan.conf.sample to pop3vscan.conf and modify
%%PREFIX%%/etc/pop3vscan.conf and/or %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/pop3vscan.sh to
fit your environment.

Don't forget to copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/pop3vscan.mail.sample to pop3vscan.mail
and edit your own template for virus notifications.

By the way, you need to enable the IPFIREWALL opion in kernel. Please note,
that IPFIREWALL_FORWARD might be needed on older systems as well.
Then add the following forwarding rule into your IPFW table,

# ipfw add fwd 192.168.0.254,8110 tcp from 192.168.0.0/24 to any pop3

where 192.168.0.254 is the IP of your internal interface, 8110 is the
default port of POP3VScan, and 192.168.0.0/24 is the IP range of your LAN.
