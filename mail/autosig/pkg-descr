                        Auto-Sig v2.3
                        -------------

This application is used to generate .signature and .plan files from a list of
quotes. The files are generated by combining a constant header file with one
quote which is randomly selected from the quote file. This package includes the
source which can be used to build the autosig application and a number of
sample shell script which demonstrate how everything works.
