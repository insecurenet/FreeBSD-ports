The svnmailer is a tool, which is usually called by a subversion hook
to submit commit notifications in various ways (at the moment: mail via
SMTP or a pipe to a sendmail like program, news via NNTP, CIA live
tracker notification via XML-RPC). It is derived from the original
mailer.py distributed with subversion, but supposed to be much more
consistent, better extensible and to have much more features. Have a
look at the documentation for further details
