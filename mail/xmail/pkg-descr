xmail is an X-based interface to the Berkeley mail program.  This
version of xmail depends heavily upon the installation of the
application default resources file for the proper declaration of
features and enhancements documented in the man pages.  If the
defaults file or the resource declarations are not installed or in
some manner made accessable to the X11 resource database manager,
xmail will operate in only a minimal fashion.

This version of xmail includes support for decompressing and
displaying the content of an X-Face mail header, if such a header
exists in the message being read.  This feature is a compile time
option, and requires the existence of the compface library routines,
which are NOT supplied with the xmail sources.    X-Face headers
are compressed bitmap images, typically of the face of the person
owning such a header.  The compressed header contains only printable
characters, which allows it to be included in a mail message.
