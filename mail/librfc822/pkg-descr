librfc822 provides application developers with a complete parser for RFC822
addresses. Not only can you use the library to verify that RFC822 addresses
are syntactically correct, you can also have an address split up into its
semantic parts, what is needed when deciding where to route an address to, etc.

What is quite unique is that librfc822 does indeed parse all address types
allowed by the standard. That includes such weird things as "address groups"
or addresses with whitespace and comments throw in.
