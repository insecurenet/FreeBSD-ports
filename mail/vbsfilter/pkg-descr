vbsfilter will rename VBS and SHS attachments to .txt,
thus rendering them harmless.

Sendmail 8.10 introduced a new feature called the milter library,
which provides filtering callbacks to a user-level program, which in
turn can provide a "Yes"/"No"/"I haven't seen enough yet" answer to
the question: Can sendmail allow this mail to be delivered?
