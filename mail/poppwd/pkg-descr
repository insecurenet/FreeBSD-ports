This program implements the Eudora password changing protocol. This protocol
allows remote users to change their password and is supported by mail clients
such as Eudora, NuPOP and a variety of webmail systems.

poppwd supports PAM and so can be used against almost any password database,
including local password files, LDAP or SQL databases.
