Pathalias computes the shortest	paths  and  corresponding
routes from one host (computer system) to all other known,
reachable hosts.  Pathalias reads host-to-host  connectiv-
ity  information  on standard input or in the named files,
and writes a list of host-route pairs on the standard out-
put.

pathalias, written by steve bellovin and peter honeyman, is in the
public domain, and may be used by any person or organization, in
any way and for any purpose.
