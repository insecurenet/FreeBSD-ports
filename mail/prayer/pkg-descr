Prayer is yet another Webmail interface for IMAP servers on Unix systems.

It exists because we weren't terribly happy about the characteristics of
existing Webmail interfaces: in particular scalability problems with common
open source Webmail packages and the lack of flexibility that commercial
packages would give us. This doesn't mean that Prayer is trying to compete
with existing Webmail packages. It just means that Prayer is better suited
to our particular environment.
