The MailScanner port is using the original MailScanner tarball from 
www.mailscanner.info. Unfortunately the tarball consists of MailScanner
and perl modules etc, MailScanner depends on. The port is not using
Julian's install.sh or the provided modules. All modules that MailScanner
depends on are installed via ports as well.

In order to make the installation FreeBSD compliant the port installs files
in the following directories:

/usr/local/sbin			MailScanner binary
/usr/local/libexec/MailScanner	virus wrapper/autoupdate, cron-scripts etc.
/usr/local/lib/MailScanner	MailScanner Perl libraries
/usr/local/share/MailScanner	MailScanner report templates
/usr/local/share/doc/MailScanner	Documentation
/usr/local/etc/MailScanner	MailScanner config files / rules
/usr/local/etc/rc.d		start/stop scripts

The port installs two start/stop scripts in /usr/local/etc/rc.d:

mailscanner
mta

My suggestion is to use mta instead of the usual FreeBSD MTA startup
process. This of course means that you will have to disable MTA startup 
in rc.conf completely. Put this in your rc.conf:

sendmail_enable="NONE"

Please have a look at the provided start scripts for settings you have to
make in rc.conf.

When upgrading the port it will try to look for new options/variables in
MailScanner.conf using Julians upgrade_MailScanner_conf script. If it finds
changes it will create a newly merged MailScanner.conf and copy it to
/usr/local/etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf.new.PORTVERSION. Moreover the 
port will try to update all your languages conf files.


If you have suggestions for this port please contact the port maintainer.
