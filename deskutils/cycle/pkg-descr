Cycle is a calendar for women.  Given a cycle length or statistics for
several periods, it can calculate the days until menstruation, the days of
"safe" sex, the fertile period, the days of ovulation, and define the date
of birth of a child.  It allows the user to write notes and helps to
supervise the reception of hormonal contraceptive pills.  Main features:

  - Calculate days of menstruation, based on the length of the cycle or on
    statistics of previous periods
  - Calculate days of "safe" sex, fertile period, and days of ovulation
  - Definition of D.o.B. (Date of Birth) of a child
  - Allows to write notes
  - Helps to supervise reception of hormonal contraceptive pills
  - Multiple users allowed, data is protected by a password for every user

NOTE: This program is not a reliable contraceptive method.  It neither does
help to prevent sexual transmission diseases like AIDS.  It is just a nice
tool for keeping track of some of your medical data and extracting some
statistical conclusions from them.  You cannot consider this program as a
substitute for your gynecologist in any way.  You have been warned!
