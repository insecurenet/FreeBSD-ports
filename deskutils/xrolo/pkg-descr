Rolo  is  a  tool for the Sun workstation which presents a
user interface to a simple database of notes in  a  manner
which  approximates  a  Rolodex  file.

Each  note  in  your  Rolo file is meant to simulate a 3x5
card upon which you may scribble anything you  like.   You
can  have  any  number of cards in your rolodex, Rolo will
keep track of them for you.  You may browse around through
them,  create  new  ones,  throw old ones away, search for
strings in them, etc.
