Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program for Linux based operating systems
such as Ubuntu. You can take a screenshot of a specific area, window, your
whole screen, or even of a website - apply different effects to it, draw on it
to highlight points, and then upload to an image hosting site, all within one
window. Shutter is free, open-source, and licensed under GPL v3.
