cdcat is a powerful Qt based tool for creating fully searchable offline
catalogs of the contents of any arbitrary media. Primarily it is most
useful for cataloging CDs, DVDs, and other such removable media. The
catalogs can be quickly searched (including across multiple catalogs)
with regular expressions, exported as CSV or HTML files, sorted, and
statistical information gathered.
