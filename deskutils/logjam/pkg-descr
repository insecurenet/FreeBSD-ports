"LiveJournal.com... because you like to think other people care." LogJam is
a GTK2 client for the LiveJournal API.  It sits unobtrusively in the corner
of your screen, waiting for you to have something worthwhile to tell the
world.  It can read your current music from XMMS, spellcheck with gtkspell,
and offers preview capabilities using gtkhtml3.  It will interface with any
site running LiveJournal, not just www.livejournal.com, and can create
offline copies of your journal.
