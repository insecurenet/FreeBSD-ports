dvips2ascii
-----------

This is a PostScript-to-ascii converter which works for PostScript
files created by dvips. Results are usually better than using ps2ascii
which comes with ghostscript.

USAGE: dvips2ascii < psfile > asciifile

dvips2ascii is a perl script, therefore it is slow. There is limited
support for accented characters (mainly german umlauts). Let me know
if you want support for other special characters.
