If PDF is electronic paper, then pdftk is an electronic staple-remover,
hole-punch, binder, secret-decoder-ring, and X-Ray-glasses.
Pdftk is a simple tool for doing everyday things with PDF documents.
Keep one in the top drawer of your desktop and use it to:

Merge PDF Documents
Split PDF Pages into a New Document
Decrypt Input as Necessary (Password Required)
Encrypt Output as Desired
Burst a PDF Document into Single Pages
Report on PDF Metrics, including Metadata and Bookmarks
Uncompress and Re-Compress Page Streams
Repair Corrupted PDF (Where Possible)

Pdftk is also an example of how to use a library of Java classes
in a stand-alone C++ program. Specifically, it demonstrates how GCJ and CNI
allow C++ code to use iText's (itext-paulo) Java classes.
