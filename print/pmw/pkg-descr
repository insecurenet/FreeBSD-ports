Philip's Music Writer (PMW) is a computer program for high quality
music typesetting. Originally written for Acorn RISC OS computers,
there is now a version that runs on Unix and Unix-like systems.

PMW operates by reading an input file containing an encoded
description of the music; such a file can be constructed using any
text editor or word processor. The music encoding is very
straightforward and compact, and quick to enter.

PMW comes with a PostScript outline font that contains all the musical
shapes (notes, rests, accidentals, bar lines, clefs, etc.) that it
requires. There is a man page for the command line options, and a
200-page manual that is distributed as a PDF file.
