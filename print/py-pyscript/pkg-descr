PyScript is a python module for producing high quality postscript
graphics. Rather than use a GUI to draw a picture, the picture is
programmed using python and the PyScript objects.

Some of the key features are:

    * All scripting is done in python, which is a high level, easy
      to learn, well-developed scripting language.
    * All the objects can be translated, scaled, rotated, ... in fact
      any affine transformation.
    * Plain text is automatically kerned.
    * You can place arbitrary LaTeX expressions on your figures.
    * You can create your own figure objects, and develop a library
      of figure primitives.
    * Output is publication quality.
