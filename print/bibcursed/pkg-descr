Bibcursed is a simple program to make life a little easier when using
BibTeX bibliographies. It currently provides these main functions:

  - Adding references to your bibliography. This is done with prompts so
    templates for the different entries (article, proceedings, etc) do
    not have to be remembered. Error checking is used so that the required
    fields have to be supplied, and incorrect fields cannot be entered.
    New entries are inserted into the 'correct' place in the BibTeX file
  - Clean and easy removal of entries
  - Viewing of entries and changing of fields
  - Easy searching of entries, including search by field
