XPP is a graphical utility for managing printers and submitting print jobs.
It interfaces with CUPS on the backend and allows the user to configure
double sided printing, active tray, color adjustment, etc.  It supports the
command line flags of lpr as well.

You will first need to configure a printer via CUPS to use XPP.
