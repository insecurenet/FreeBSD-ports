Apsfilter is a magic printfilter, that allows you to print different
document types "automagically" without having to convert them manually
into something which is understood by your lineprinter. Apsfilter
development started in 1993, so apsfilter is now a mature and powerful
printing solution for any flavour of Unix running lpd or LPRng as line
printer scheduler. It supports the latest ghostscript version and 3rd
party printer driver like hpijs, ijs, hpdj, pcl3 and gimp-print, to
mention some.
