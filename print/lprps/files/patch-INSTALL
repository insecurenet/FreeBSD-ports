 You need to add an entry in /etc/printcap.  Here's the entry I use:

 you want.  The `ms' capabability is a Sun extension.  If you decide to
 make use of the patches in lpr.diff, you should also add the `ex'

 You must also set the printer's communication parameters. Make sure
 you have an entry like this in /etc/remote:
