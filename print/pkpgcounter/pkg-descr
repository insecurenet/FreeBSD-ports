pkpgcounter is a generic Page Description Language parser which can
either count the number of pages or compute the percent of ink coverage
needed to print various types of documents.

It currently supports the following file types:
  - PostScript (both DSC compliant and binary)
  - PDF
  - PCL3/4/5
  - PCLXL (aka PCL6)
  - DVI
  - TIFF
  - ESC/P2
  - OpenDocument (ISO/IEC DIS 26300)
  - Zenographics ZjStream
  - Samsung QPDL (aka SPL2)
  - Samsung SPL1

The five latter ones, as well as some TIFF documents, are currently
only supported in page counting mode.
