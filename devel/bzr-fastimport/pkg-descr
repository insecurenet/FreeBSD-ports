Bazaar Fast Import is a plugin providing fast loading of revision control data
into Bazaar.  It is designed to be used in combination with front-end programs
that generate a command/data stream for it to process. Front-ends are available
for a wide range of foreign VCS tools including Subversion, CVS, Git,
Mercurial, Darcs and Perforce. New front-ends are easy to develop in whatever
programming language you prefer, making Bazaar Fast Import useful for teams
needing a custom migration solution.
