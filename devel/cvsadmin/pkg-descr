cvsadmin is a simple program to administrate users of a CVS repository.

It currently allows you to easily :

      Name    Arguments
      ----    ---------
      list    list of usernames || nothing
      add     list of usernames
      del     list of usernames
      email   user list
      rename  list of alternating olduser/newuser
      misc    list of usernames
      sys     list of usernames
      pass    list of usernames

The actions name should be self-explaining, except misc, which ask you for
all the fields (email, system user, password) on your terminal.
