This package provides functions to fork threads and wait for their result,
whether it's an exception or a normal value. Besides waiting for the
termination of a single thread this packages also provides functions to
wait for a group of threads to terminate. This package is similar to the
"threadmanager", "async" and "spawn" packages. The advantages of this
package are:

  * Simpler API.
  * More efficient in both space and time.
  * No space-leak when forking a large number of threads.
  * Correct handling of asynchronous exceptions.
  * GHC specific functionality like `forkOn` and `forkIOWithUnmask`.
