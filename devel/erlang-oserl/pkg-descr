The Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) in telecommunications is an
open, industry standard protocol designed to provide a flexible
data communication interface for the transfer of short message data
between External Short Messaging Entities (ESME), Routing Entities
(RE) and Message Centres.

The oserl library provides an Erlang framework to interface with
SMPP entities.
