In order to provide a faster and simpler working model, this plugin
tries to support a configuration similar to git and Mercurial's
colocated branches, where there is a single working tree that can
be switched between multiple branches that all co-exist in the same
directory. This working model is entirely possible using Bazaar's
existing technology, and this plugin aims to make it as simple as
possible to use that model.
