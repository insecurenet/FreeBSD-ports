Buildtool is a set of utilities which will make your programs more portable
and easier to build on any kind of Unix-like system. All the utilities are
integrated with each other, which means that they all work together. It is
completely free, licensed under the terms of the BSD license.

If you have ever used GNU automake, autoconf and/or libtool, you will find
buildtool very similar. In fact, it is an implementation of the ideas of the
GNU programs, but with a completely different design.
