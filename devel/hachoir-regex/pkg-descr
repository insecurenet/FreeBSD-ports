hachoir-regex is a Python library for regular expression manipulation.
You can use a|b (or) and a+b (and) operators. Expressions are optimized
during the construction: merge ranges, simplify repetitions, etc. It
also contains a class for pattern matching allowing to search multiple
strings and regex at the same time.
