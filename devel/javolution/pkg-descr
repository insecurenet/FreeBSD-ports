Javolution is the Java solution for real-time and embedded systems.
Javolution real-time goals are simple: to make your application
faster and more time predictable!

That being accomplished through:
 * High performance and time-deterministic (real-time)
   util / lang / text / io / xml base classes.
 * Context programming in order to achieve true separation of
   concerns (logging, performance, etc).
 * A testing framework addressing not only unit tests but also
   performance and regression tests as well.
 * Straightforward and low-level parallel computing capabilities
   with ConcurrentContext.
 * Struct and Union base classes for direct interfacing with native
   applications (e.g. C/C++).
 * World's fastest and first hard real-time XML
   marshalling/unmarshalling facility.
 * Simple yet flexible configuration management of your application.
