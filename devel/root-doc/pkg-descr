This package contains HTML documentation for the Root framework.

ROOT stand for "<R>OOTs <O>bject-<O>riented <T>echnologies" - it is an object
oriented data analysis framework written in C++. ROOT has its origin at the
Centre Europeenne pour la Recherche Nucleaire (CERN) and is a cross platform
tool well-known to high energy physicists, but it's also used in a wide range
of other data analysis applications. The system consists of the C/C++
interpreter CINT (for interactive development and rapid prototyping) and
hundreds of classes, which provides functionalities u.a. for:

 - Data Histogram and Minimization Operations
 - Linear Algebra, Matrix and Vector Operations
 - Tree, Ntuple and other Data Containers/Structures
 - 2D Graphics, 3D Graphics and Detector Geometry Modeling
 - Graphical User Interface
 - Operating System and Networking Interface
 - Inline Documentation and PostScript Interface
 - PROOF Server (parallel computing)
