Kimwitu is a system that supports the construction of programs that use
trees or terms as their main data structure. It is a `meta-tool' in the
development process of tools. Its input is an abstract description of
terms, annotated with implementation directives, plus a definition of
functions on these terms. The output consists of a number of C-files that
contain data-structure definitions for the terms, a number of standard
functions on those terms, and a translation (in C) of the function
definitions in the input (eg. term rewriting).

The standard functions can be used to create terms, compare them for
equality, read and write them on files in various formats and do
manipulations like list concatenation.
