The Apache Hive data warehouse software facilitates querying and managing
large datasets residing in distributed storage.  Hive provides a mechanism
to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like
language called HiveQL.  At the same time this language also allows
traditional map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers and
reducers when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in HiveQL.
