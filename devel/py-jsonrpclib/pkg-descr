This library implements the JSON-RPC 2.0 proposed specification in pure Python.
It is designed to be as compatible with the syntax of xmlrpclib as possible (it
extends where possible), so that projects using xmlrpclib could easily be
modified to use JSON and experiment with the differences.

It is backwards-compatible with the 1.0 specification, and supports all of the
new proposed features of 2.0, including:
    * Batch submission (via MultiCall)
    * Keyword arguments
    * Notifications (both in a batch and 'normal')
    * Class translation using the 'jsonclass' key.
