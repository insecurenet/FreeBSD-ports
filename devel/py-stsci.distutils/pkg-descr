This package contains utilities used to package some of STScI's Python
projects, specifically those projects that comprise stsci_python and Astrolib.

It currently consists mostly of some setup_hook scripts meant for use with
distutils2/packaging and/or d2to1, and a customized easy_install command meant
for use with distribute.

This package is not meant for general consumption, though it might be worth
looking at for examples of how to do certain things with your own packages.
