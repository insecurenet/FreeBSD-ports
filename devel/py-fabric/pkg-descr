Fabric is a simple pythonic remote deployment tool.

It is designed to upload files to, and run shell commands on, a number
of servers in parallel or serially. These commands are grouped in tasks
(regular python functions) and specified in a 'fabfile.'

This is called remote automation, and the primary use case is deploying
applications to multiple similar hosts.
