PHP Judy implements sparse dynamic arrays (aka Judy Arrays). This extension
is based on the Judy C library. A Judy array consumes memory only when it is
populated, yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory if desired.
Judy's key benefits are scalability, high performance, and memory efficiency.
