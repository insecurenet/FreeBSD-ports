This simple module serves one purpose - to provide a simple means to read (or
slurp) an entire file into memory for processing. This module allows the
replacement of the prototypical foreach- or while- loops used for opening
and reading of files with single-line constructs.

Of note with this module is that the magic of the @ARGV variable and the
input record separator, $/, are used to facilitate the reading of entire
files into either an array or scalar using minimal code.
