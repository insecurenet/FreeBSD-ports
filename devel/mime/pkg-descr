This package allows you to decode multipart mime messages. I wrote
this so that my cgiparse library can understand multipart/form-data.
I was looking at the various ways of doing it with out designing an
entire library. After thinking about the problem, there were to many
edge cases, and designing an entire library would be better. This is
the results of the work. It definitely could use some cleaning up.
