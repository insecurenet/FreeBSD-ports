Dynamic programming is a simple yet powerful technique for solving optimisation
problems. When the problem at hand can be split in smaller problems, such that
the smaller solutions of an optimal solution are themselves optimal, dynamic
programming can be used to avoid re-calculating solutions to shared sub-
problems.

Simple problems are both easily specified and easily implemented, but for
complex problems translating the specification of the problem into the
implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm becomes tedious and error
prone. The goal of DPROG is to alleviate this by automatically translating the
specification of the problem into an implementation of the solution.

The DPROG language is designed to be close to the ``mathematical'' notation
used for expressing recurrences, thus making it easier to specify the problem.
Using the DPROG compiler, the manual implementation step can be completely
avoided.
