A configuration management library for programs and daemons.

Features include:

 * Automatic, dynamic reloading in response to modifications to configuration
   files.

 * A simple, but flexible, configuration language, supporting several of
   the most commonly needed types of data, along with interpolation of
   strings from the configuration or the system environment (e.g.
   $(HOME)).

 * Subscription-based notification of changes to configuration properties.

 * An import directive allows the configuration of a complex application
   to be split across several smaller files, or common configuration data
   to be shared across several applications.
