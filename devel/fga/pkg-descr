FGA is a simple yet powerful implementation of a general genetic algorithm, and
provides many types of crossover and selection procedures.

It is suitable to solve mathematical problems such as combinatorial
optimization ones, as well as to build artificial life simulations.

Written in C++, the library is released under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and it's easy to incorporate in other applications.

A parallel version of the algorithm (using POSIX threads) is included in order
to take advantage of multi-processor environments.
