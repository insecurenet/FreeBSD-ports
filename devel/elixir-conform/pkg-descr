The definition of conform is "Adapt or conform oneself to new or
different conditions". As this library is used to adapt your
application to its deployed environment, I think it's rather fitting.
It's also a play on the word configuration, and the fact that Conform
uses an init-style configuration, maintained in a .conf file.

Conform is a library for Elixir applications. Its original intended
use is in exrm as means of providing a simplified configuration
file for deployed releases, but is flexible enough to work for any
use case where you want init-style configuration translated to
Elixir/Erlang terms. It is inspired directly by basho/cuttlefish,
and in fact uses its .conf parser. Beyond that, you can look at
conform as a reduced (but growing!) implementation of cuttlefish
in Elixir.
