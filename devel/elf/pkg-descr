ELF is a command line based ELF header analyzer. This tool
allows you to easily parse the ehdr of ELF object files
into a human readable format (and various other formats).
This is a very good source of both source code (for people
learning the ELF) and information for developers that care
about the internals of object files that is generated for
them.
