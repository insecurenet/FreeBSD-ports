A continuous integration plugin for Trac.

Bitten is a Python-based framework for collecting various software
metrics via continuous integration. It builds on Trac to provide
an integrated web-based user interface. Build slaves are usually
installed and run on multiple different systems to compile and test
the software on these platforms on new checkins.

Set bitten_slave_enable to "yes" and bitten_slave_urls to contain
one or more Bitten build URLs. For form authentication add --form-auth
to flags.
