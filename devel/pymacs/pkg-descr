Pymacs is a powerful tool which, once started from Emacs, allows
both-way communication between Emacs Lisp and Python. Pymacs aims Python
as an extension language for Emacs rather than the other way around, and
this asymmetry is reflected in some design choices. Within Emacs Lisp
code, one may load and use Python modules. Python functions may
themselves use Emacs services, and handle Emacs Lisp objects kept in
Emacs Lisp space.
