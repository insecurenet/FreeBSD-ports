omniNotify is a multi-threaded implementation of the CORBA
Notification Service (CosNotification), a feature-enriched
version of the CORBA Event Service (CosEvents).
omniNotify offers asynchronous, decoupled, event-based communication
between distributed and heterogeneous applications.

The main features of omniNotify are:

* Implemented in C++.
* Scalable filter evaluation and event dispatching architecture.
* Support for push-based and pull-based event suppliers and consumers.
* Support variants of suppliers/consumers that transmit (per push/pull):
	o a CORBA::Any (a single arbitrary value);
	o a CosNotification::StructuredEvent (a single structured event);
	o a CosNotification::EventBatch (a sequence of structured events).
* Administrative and Notification QoS properties.
* Backward compatible with CosEvents.
