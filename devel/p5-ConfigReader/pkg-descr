       The ConfigReader library is a set of classes which reads
       directives from a configuration file.  The library is
       completely object oriented, and it is envisioned that
       parsers for new styles of configuration files can be
       easily added.

       ConfigReader::Spec encapsulates a specification for
       configuration directives.  You can specify which
       directives can be in the configuration file, aliases for
       the directive, whether the directive is required or has a
       default value, and how to parse the directive value.

       Here's an example of how one directive might be specified:

            required $spec 'HomePage', 'new URI::URL';

       This defines a required directive called 'HomePage'.  To
       parse the value from the configuration file, the
       URI::URL::new() method will be called with the string
       value as its argument.
