LibHID is a user-space HID access library written in C. It provides a
generic and flexible way to access and interact with USB HID devices,
much like libusb does for plain USB devices. It is based on libusb, thus
it requires no HID support in the kernel. Furthermore, it aims to
support all operating system supported by libusb: Linux, BSD, OS X, and
Windows.
