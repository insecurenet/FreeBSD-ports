This Haskell package provides ShowQ, ShowFun, and SimpleReflect.

  * ShowFun gives a Typeable-dependent instance for showing
    functions as their type.

  * ShowIO does the same for IO actions.

  * ShowQ adds SmallCheck & QuickCheck support.

  * SimpleReflect allows us to literally see how functions
    'expand', through appropriate Show magic.
