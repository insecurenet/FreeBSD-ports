ncurses (new curses) is a free software emulation of curses in
System V Rel 4.0 (and above). It uses terminfo format, supports
pads, colors, multiple highlights, form characters and function
key mapping. Because of the interactive nature of this library,
it will be of little use for writing Web applications, but may
be useful when writing scripts meant using PHP from the command
line.
