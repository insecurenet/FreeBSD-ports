Piklab is an integrated development environment (IDE) for applications
based on Microchip PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers similar to the
MPLAB environment.

It integrates with several compiler and assembler toolchains (like
gputils, sdcc, c18) and with the GPSim simulator.

It supports the most common programmers (serial, parallel, ICD2,
Pickit2, PicStart+), the ICD2 debugger, and several bootloaders
(Tiny, Pickit2, and Picdem).
