edb (Evan's Debugger) is a cross platform x86/x86-64 debugger. It
was inspired by OllyDbg, but aims to function on x86 and x86-64 as
well as multiple OS's. Linux is the only officially supported
platform at the moment, but FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OSX and Windows ports
are underway with varying degrees of functionality.
