Bazaar Explorer is a desktop application for using the Bazaar Version Control
System. It provides a high level interface to all commonly used features,
launching "applets" from the QBzr plug-in to provide most of the functionality.
Alternatively, the applets from the bzr-gtk plug-in can be used if it is
installed.
