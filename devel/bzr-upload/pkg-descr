Web sites are often hosted on servers where bzr can't be installed.
In other cases, the web site must not give access to its corresponding
branch (for security reasons for example). Finally, web hosting
providers often provides only ftp access to upload sites.

This plugin uploads only the relevant changes in your working tree
since the last upload using ftp or sftp protocols.
