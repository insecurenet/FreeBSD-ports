Poison is a new JSON library for Elixir focusing on wicked-fast
speed without sacrificing simplicity, completeness, or correctness.
Poison takes several approaches to be the fastest JSON library for
Elixir. Poison uses extensive sub binary matching, a hand-rolled
parser using several techniques that are known to benefit HiPE for
native compilation, IO list encoding and single-pass decoding.
