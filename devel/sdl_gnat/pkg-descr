The Ada compiler package GNAT GPL 2013 from Adacore contained a set of
thin bindings for the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).  These bindings have
been pulled out and packaged as a separate library.  It should be noted
that they are covered by the full GPLv3 which is not a typical license for
thin bindings.
