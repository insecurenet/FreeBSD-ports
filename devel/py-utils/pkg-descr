The Voidspace Pythonutils package is a simple way of installing the Voidspace
collection of modules. These are currently:

    ConfigObj 4.4.0 - Easy config file reading/writing
    validate 0.2.3 - Validation and type conversion system
    StandOut 3.0.0 - Simple logging and output control object
    pathutils 0.2.5 - For working with paths and files
    cgiutils 0.3.5 - CGI helpers
    urlpath 0.1.0 - Functions for handling URLs
    odict 0.2.1 - Ordered Dictionary Class

Several of the Voidspace Projects depend on these modules. They are also useful
in their own right of course. They are primarily general utility modules that
simplify common programming tasks in Python.
