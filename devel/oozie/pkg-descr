Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.
Oozie Workflow jobs are Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs) of actions.
Oozie Coordinator jobs are recurrent Oozie Workflow jobs triggered by time
(frequency) and data availabilty.

Oozie is integrated with the rest of the Hadoop stack supporting several types
of Hadoop jobs out of the box (such as Java map-reduce, Streaming map-reduce,
Pig, Hive, Sqoop and Distcp) as well as system specific jobs (such as
Java programs and shell scripts).

Oozie is a scalable, reliable and extensible system.
