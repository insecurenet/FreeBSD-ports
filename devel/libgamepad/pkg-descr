Libgamepad is an API for various gamepad devices under Unix.  The goal is
to provide both abstract and device-dependent interfaces for various joystick
and gamepad devices.  The library interfaces with multiple lower-level
interfaces, such as the BSD "joy" and "usbhid" drivers, as well as
the user-space "libhid", which in turn overlays "libusb".
