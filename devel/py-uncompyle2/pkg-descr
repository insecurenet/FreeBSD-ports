'uncompyle2' converts Python byte-code back into equivalent Python
source code. It accepts byte-code from Python version 2.5 to 2.7.
Additionally, it will only run on Python 2.7.

The generated source is very readable: docstrings, lists, tuples and
hashes get pretty-printed.

Features

	. decompiles Python byte-code into equivalent Python source
	. decompiles byte-code from Python version 2.5, 2.6, 2.7
	. pretty-prints docstrings, hashes, lists and tuples
	. reads directly from .pyc/.pyo files, bulk-decompile whole
	  directories
	. output may be written to file, a directory or to stdout
