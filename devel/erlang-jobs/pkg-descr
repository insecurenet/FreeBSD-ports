Jobs is a job scheduler for load regulation of Erlang applications.

It provides a queueing framework where each queue can be configured
for throughput rate, credit pool and feedback compensation. Queues
can be added and modified at runtime, and customizable "samplers"
propagate load status across all nodes in the system.
