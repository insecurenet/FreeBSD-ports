Frama-C is a suite of tools dedicated to the analysis of the source code of
software written in C.

Frama-C gathers several static analysis techniques in a single collaborative
framework, which allows static analyzers to build upon the results already
computed by other analyzers in the framework, and provides sophisticated
tools, such as a slicer and dependency analysis.

Frama-C is closer to heuristic bug-finding tools than it is to software metrics
tools, but it has two important differences with the former: it aims at being
"correct" -- that is, never to remain silent for a location in the source
code where an error can happen at run-time. And it allows its user to
manipulate functional specifications, and to prove that the source code
satisfies these specifications.
