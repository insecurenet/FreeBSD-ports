This package provides a set of helper programs necessary to build the
Gtk2Hs suite of libraries.  These tools include a modified c2hs binding
tool that is used to generated FFI declarations, a tool to build a type
hiearchy that mirrors the C type hiearchy of GObjects found in glib, and
a generator for signal declarations that are used to call back from C to
Haskell.  These tools are not needed to actually run Gtk2Hs programs.
