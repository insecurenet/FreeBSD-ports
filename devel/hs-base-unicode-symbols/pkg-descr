This package defines new symbols for a number of functions, operators
and types in the base package.  All symbols are documented with their
actual definition and information regarding their Unicode code point.
They should be completely interchangeable with their definitions.

For further Unicode goodness you can enable the UnicodeSyntax language
extension.  This extension enables Unicode characters to be used to
stand for certain ASCII character sequences.
