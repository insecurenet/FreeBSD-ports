Configuration Instructions for Flyspray
=======================================

0) If you are upgrading from a previous version of flyspray, please skip to
   the Upgrading section below.

1) Create a database for Flyspray to use.  Here is one way to do that, from 
   the unix/linux command line, entering your mysql root password (in case
   using mysql backend) when prompted:

For MySQL:
# mysqladmin -u root -p create flyspray

For PostgreSQL:
# createdb -U pgsql flyspray

2) Insert the following configuration into your Apache httpd.conf:

	Alias "/flyspray/" "%%FLYSPRAYDIR%%/"
        <Directory %%FLYSPRAYDIR%%>
                AllowOverride All
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
        </Directory>

3) If this is a new Flyspray installation, install the default configuration
   file and edit to taste:

# cp %%FLYSPRAYDIR%%/flyspray.conf.php-dist %%FLYSPRAYDIR%%/flyspray.conf.php

   Then point your browser to http://yourserver.example.com/flyspray/ and
   you should see the Flyspray installer.

4) Once the setup procedure has been completed, you must remove the "setup"
   directory:

# rm -rf %%FLYSPRAYDIR%%/setup/

5) Log in using the Admin account you just created, and click on the admin
   links to set up your Options and lists.

6) Close the sample task, and begin adding your own.

7) Report any bugs you find back to http://bugs.flyspray.org/ or the mailing
   list linked from the Flyspray homepage.

Upgrading from previous versions of Flyspray
============================================

You can upgrade from a previous version of Flyspray by doing the following:

0) read %%DOCSDIR%%/UPGRADING.txt.

1) back up your old flyspray task database using "mysqldump" for mysql and
   "pg_dump" for postgresql.  No, really, you seriously run the risk of 
   losing data if you don't do this.

2) save a copy of %%FLYSPRAYDIR%%/flyspray.conf.php before running
   portupgrade.  This will need to be restored after you've upgraded the
   package.

3) load http://yourserver.example.com/flyspray/setup/upgrade.php in your
   browser and follow the instructions.

sql> update flyspray_prefs set pref_value = "0.9.9 dev" where pref_name = "fs_ver";

4) That's it! Flyspray has been upgraded to the current version.  If you messed up
   somehow, you will probably have lost data in the process, and may need to
   re-install your database from your backup, but that's ok because you took
   a backup, right?
