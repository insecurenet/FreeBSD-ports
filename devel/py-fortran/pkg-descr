Pyfort is a tool for connecting Fortran routines (and "Fortran-like" C) to
Python and its Numerical Python array extension. Pyfort translates an module
file that describes the routines you wish to access from Python into a C
language source file defining a Python module. Pyfort will also build and
install this extension into Python.
