exmpp is a fast and scalable library for the Extensible Messaging and Presence
Protocol (XMPP) written in Erlang/OTP.

Main features:
 - Based on Erlang message reception and pattern matching. The programming
   style is close to Erlang approach and lead to very short pieces of code.
 - Support for both formating of client and server packets.
 - Based on Erlang atoms and binary to limit memory consumption. It can be
   used to write a highly scalable XMPP proxy or XMPP server.
 - SSL support.
 - Several different XML parsers can be used (expat, libxml2).
