An Open Source Implementation of the Actor Model in C++.

Actors in CAF are lightweight, consist of only a few hundred bytes, and
are cooperatively managed by a state-of-the-art, work-stealing
scheduler. You can spawn millions of actors if you want to.

CAF offers a network-transparent message passing. Actors can talk to
each other, no matter where they've been spawned. You do the hard part
of implementing your app, CAF takes care of the low-level side of
things. CAF allows you to transparently connect actors running on
different machines and OSes via the network. It integrates multiple
computing devices such as multi-core CPUs, GPGPUs, and even embedded
hardware. You can also create message passing interface for your OpenCL
backends.
