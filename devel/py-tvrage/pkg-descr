tvrage is a python based object oriented client interface for tvrage.com's
XML based api feeds.

The tvrage package consists of three modules:
 - feeds module provides a wrapper function for each of tvrage's XML-feeds
 - api module provides an clean and object oriented interface on top of those
   services
 - quickinfo module is a simple pythonic wrapper for tvrage's quickinfo api.
   Values are returned as python dictionaries rather than dedicated objects
   for tv shows and episodes
