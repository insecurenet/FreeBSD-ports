Lock file is a traditional means of synchronization among processes. In this
module it is implemented as an empty regular file exclusively locked using
fcntl.lockf. When it is to be released it is removed by default. However, if
all cooperating processes turn off the removal, they get a guaranteed order of
acquisitions and better scalability.
