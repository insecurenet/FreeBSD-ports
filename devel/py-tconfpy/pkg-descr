'tconfpy' is an advanced configuration file parser and validator for
Python programs.  By using 'tconfpy', Python programmers can provide
their users with an external configuration file for setting program
options, defining defaults, and so on.  'tconfpy' offloads the
responsibility for parsing and validating a configuration file from
the main application. The Python programmer need only deal
with the results and any errors or warnings generated during the
parsing process.
