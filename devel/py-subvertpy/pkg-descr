This is an implementation of Python bindings for the Subversion
version control system, aiming to be complete, fast and feel native
to Python programmers.

Bindings are provided for the working copy, client, delta, remote
access and repository APIs. A hookable server side implementation
of the custom Subversion protocol (svn_ra) is also provided.
