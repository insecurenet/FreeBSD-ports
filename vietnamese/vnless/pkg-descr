A paginator similar to "more" or "pg", but much more powerful and speaks
Vietnamese.

VNless is a port of a very old version of GNU's less that suports the display
of files written in the Vietnamese language using the VISCII (VIetnamese
Standard Code for Information Interchange) encoding, RFC 1456.

VNless should be run w/in a VNterm or simular terminal emulator supporting
Vietnamese language encodings.
