    Vnpstext converts your 8-bit Vietnamese text to a PostScript
    file suitable for printing to a PostScript printer.  To use it
    you need to have an 8-bit Vietnamese text file (VISCII, RFC 1456),
    which may be created with an editor like Vnelvis, or converted from
    Viet-Std 7-bit (VIQR, quoted-readable) format using vn7to8.
