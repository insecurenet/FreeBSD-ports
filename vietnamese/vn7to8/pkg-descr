The two programs "vn7to8" and "vn8to7" convert between the 7-bit
VIQR format for Vietnamese (Viet-Net like) and the 8-bit VISCII
data formats (RFC 1456).

The current supported version is VISCII 1.1.

The program "vn80to81" converts files from VISCII 1.0 to VISCII 1.1.

For complete details, please see the Viet-Std documents published elsewhere.
