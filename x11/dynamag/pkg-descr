from the source:

   This is a major rewrite of the xmag program distributed by MIT with
   X11R5.  It features three modes of magnification.  The magnifier
   can be made to follow the mouse pointer around, displaying a
   magnified image either in a window that is "sticky" to the pointer,
   or in a stationary window.  The magnifier can also be `anchored'
   to continually magnify a fixed area of the screen.

The sticky window does not work.
