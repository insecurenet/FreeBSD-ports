The purpose of XBanner is to make the XDM login screen beautiful, as opposed
to the dull and gray login screen that the vanilla XDM gives. The idea came
from Digital's login screen which displays the Digital logo nicely. I use
Linux and wanted to run XDM, but XDM's login screen was such a boring thing,
so I wrote XBanner!
