Xcmd is a front-end for starting programs under X11.
You can tell xcmd to look for a window with a specific
class, resource name, or title string (using the
`--find-<property>' options); if it finds one or more,
xcmd will `raise' them, otherwise it will run the
command you specify. You can tell xcmd to run commands
that create their own windows (using `--xcmd'), or to
run commands inside a terminal window (using `--cmd')
with various options.
