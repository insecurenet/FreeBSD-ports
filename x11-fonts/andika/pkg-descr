The Andika font is designed to work on systems and with applications that
provide support for TrueType fonts and for Unicode character encoding.
This includes Microsoft Windows 9x or greater, as well as recent versions
of the Mac OS (version 9.0 and later), and also some implementations of
Unix / Linux (TrueType font support on Unix and Linux may depend upon the
particular applications in use). On some systems (true, at least, of
32-bit Windows), it can also be used with older applications that use
legacy, industry-standard, 8-bit character encodings.

The preceding characterization of system requirements describes the
minimum needed to display characters. Realizing the full capabilities of
this font involves additional requirements. This font is designed to work
with either of two advanced font technologies, Graphite or OpenType.
To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this font,
you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support
for Graphite and OpenType.
