Note: The port x11-fonts/fonts-indic is a collection of Indic font by the
Lohit project and installs a font subset of this port, the Lohit family;
but, although the origin of fonts is the same, the Lohit project, that
distfile is maintained by Gentoo people, and have different revisions.
You can install merely also that port and, if, for any reasons, you want
to use a particular font set, you have to change the loading priority in
your configuration files.
