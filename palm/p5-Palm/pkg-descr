	This is a set of Perl 5 modules for reading, manipulating, and
writing the .prc and .pdb database files used by PalmOS devices such
as the PalmPilot.
	It is fairly easy to extend the functionality of this package
by writing parsers for any .pdb type that you like. This package
includes sample modules to parse the databases created by the built-in
applications (Address, Datebook, Mail, Memo, ToDo).

	These modules were written to support ColdSync, a Palm
synchronization tool for Unix.
