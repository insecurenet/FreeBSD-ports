Suck and blow are simple companion utilities for sending data over
a TCP socket.  They are easy to use and appropriate when FTP is
unavailable, or too much of a hassle, e.g., in single-user mode,
from within shell scripts, etc.

Blow reads the data from standard input, while suck writes it to
standard output.  Either program may originate the TCP connection,
and the TCP port may be specified if desired.
