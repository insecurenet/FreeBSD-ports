wmlj monitors your Friends List at LiveJournal.com, an online
journaling service. It's designed to sit at your WindowMaker dock
panel. It checks the Friends List for updates every given time
interval, and if some of your friends post new entries, it signals
you with a neat graphic animation sequence.
