Freenet6 is an IPv6 access service offered for free to the community.
This service enables thousands of people from all over the world
to experience the best solution for a smooth and incremental
deployment of IPv6. Freenet6 users can get IPv6 connectivity from
anywhere, including from behind any NAT device or from outside of
their home network.

On Freenet6, a single, permanent IPv6 address and a DNS name are
assigned to each user, making their PC reachable from anywhere on
the IPv6 internet. A full /48 prefix may also be assigned to a
router, enabling the distribution of IPv6 connectivity to an entire
network.  Freenet 6 - Get Connected For Free!

Instead of a Web interface, which is usually offered by traditional
tunnel brokers, Freenet6 uses an innovative model based on a
client/server architecture. The Gateway6 Client is software that
usually runs on a PC and that implements the Tunnel Setup Protocol
(TSP). The Gateway6 Client is used to automatically negotiate a
configured tunnel between a PC or router and the Freenet6 tunnel
broker, making IPv6 easy to install and maintain. The Gateway6
Client source code is licensed under the GPL. A commercial license
is also available.
