Welcome to pfflowd, a PF to NetFlow converter daemon

pfflowd is a daemon which converts status update packets from pf(4) sent 
over its pfsync(4) interface to Cisco NetFlow(tm) datagrams. These UDP 
datagrams are then exported to a host of your choice.

This version supports pfsync(4) version 3, as used by OpenBSD 3.9 and
above. Older versions are not supported.

More details about pfflowd's function and usage may be found in the
supplied manpage, which you can view prior to installation using 

/usr/bin/nroff -mandoc pfflowd.8 | less

pfflowd itself is licensed under a two-term BSD license (see the source
files for details).
