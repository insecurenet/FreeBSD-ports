Net Ldap is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP object interface to
ldapservers. It does not contain all of Net::LDAPs features,
but has:
* A simple OO-interface to connections, searches and entries.
* Support for tls and ldap v3.
* Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldapentries.
* Support for schema handling.
