Neubot is a research project on network neutrality of the NEXA Center for
Internet & Society at Politecnico di Torino. The project is based on a
lightweight open-source program that interested users can download and install
on their computers. The program runs in background and periodically performs
transmission tests with some test servers and with other instances of the
program itself. These transmission tests probe the Internet using various
application level protocols. The program saves tests results locally and uploads
them on the project servers. The collected dataset contains samples from various
Providers and allows to monitor network neutrality.
