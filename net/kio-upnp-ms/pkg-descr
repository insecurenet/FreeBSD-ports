This KIO slave enables KDE applications to access
files over the UPnP MediaServer protocol. It currently
supports both Browse and Search operations depending on
what the server supports.

The protocol is "upnp-ms://<uuid>", where UUID is the UUID
of the MediaServer device without the "uuid:" prefix.
