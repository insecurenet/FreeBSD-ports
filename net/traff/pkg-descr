WHAT IS IT?
  Traff is a program that attaches itself to one or more
  network interfaces, sniffs all IP-packages passing at it and
  accounts each packets size. The collected information can be
  dumped to a mysql-Database, for further processing.
  The configuration is very flexible, allowing you to create
  different/multiple accounting rules.
