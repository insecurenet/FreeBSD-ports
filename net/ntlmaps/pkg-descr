NTLM Authorization Proxy Server (APS) is a proxy software that allows you
to authenticate via an MS Proxy Server using the proprietary NTLM protocol.
Since version 0.9.5 APS has an ability to behave as a standalone proxy server
and authenticate http clients at web servers using NTLM method. It can change
arbitrary values in your client's request header so that those requests will
look like they were created by MS IE.
