PFinger consists of server and client for the standard finger service.

The PFinger server is a replacement for the standard Unix finger server. It
also implements the pip-protocol which could become the finger v2 protocol.
Its advantage over existing finger servers like GNU Finger or similar
enhanced Finger servers are its configurability, compatibility and security
(e.g. the server does not run as root).

The Pfinger client can be used for several tasks: First it provides an easy
way to edit the information the PFinger Server gives out about you. Then it
can be used as graphical version of the standard finger client to monitor
who is online.
