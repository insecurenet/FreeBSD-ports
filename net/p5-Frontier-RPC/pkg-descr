Frontier::RPC implements UserLand Software's XML RPC (Remote Procedure
Calls using Extensible Markup Language).  Frontier::RPC includes both a
client module for making requests to a server and a daemon module for
implementing servers.  Frontier::RPC uses RPC2 format messages.

RPC client connections are made by creating instances of Frontier::Client
objects that record the server name, and then issuing `call' requests that
send a method name and parameters to the server.

RPC daemons are mini-HTTP servers (using HTTP::Daemon from the `libwww'
Perl module).  Daemons are created by first defining the procedures you
want to make available to RPC and then passing a list of those procedures
as you create the Frontier::Daemon object.

The Frontier::RPC2 module implements the encoding and decoding of XML RPC
requests using the XML::Parser Perl module.
