MPICH2 is an implementation of the Message-Passing Interface (MPI).

The goals of MPICH2 are to provide an MPI implementation for important
platforms, including clusters, SMPs, and massively parallel processors.
It also provides a vehicle for MPI implementation research and for developing
new and better parallel programming environments
