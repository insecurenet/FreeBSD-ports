The AdaSockets library allows the use of BSD sockets from within an Ada
program.  It is limited to IP version 4 sockets (TCP, UDP, multicast).
It is released under the GNAT Modified General Public License, which
means AdaSockets can be freely used in proprietary applications without
affecting their licenses.
