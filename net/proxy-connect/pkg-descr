proxy-connect is a simple relaying command to make network connection via SOCKS
and HTTPS proxies. It is mainly intended to be used as proxy command for
OpenSSH.

Features of proxy-connect are:

    * Supports SOCKS (version 4/4a/5) and HTTPS CONNECT method.
    * Supports NO-AUTH and USERPASS authentication of SOCKS
    * Partially supports telnet proxy (experimental).
    * You can input password from tty, ssh-askpass or environment variable.
    * Simple and general program independent from OpenSSH.
    * You can also relay local socket stream instead of standard I/O.
