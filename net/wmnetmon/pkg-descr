This application uses an ICMP ping/reply scheme to periodically poll a number
of interfaces. The results are displayed as a matrix of leds, that are green
if the interface is alive, yellow if it did not respond once, and flashing red
if it keeps not responding.

You can easily check which system corresponds to each led by pointing the mouse
over the leds.

It is intended to be run from the WindowMaker dock, and it can monitor up to
63 interfaces.
