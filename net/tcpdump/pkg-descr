tcpdump is a ubiquitous network traffic capture tool available in a wide
variety of BSD, Linux and UN*X distributions.

Whilst FreeBSD has a vendor branch import of tcpdump in its source tree,
the purpose of the port is to provide a means of offering additional,
bleeding-edge features which might not make it into the tree.
