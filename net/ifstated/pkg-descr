The ifstated daemon runs commands in response to network state
changes, which it determines by monitoring interface link state or
running external tests.  For example, it can be used with carp(4) to
change running services or to ensure that carp(4) interfaces stay in
sync, or with pf(4) to test server or link availability and modify
translation or routing rules.
