Bluemix CLI provides a unified way for you to interact with your
applications, virtual servers, containers, and other components in
Bluemix through a command line interface. It also leverages command
line tools from Cloud Foundry, Docker, and the OpenStack community
when you interact with specific compute types. Bluemix CLI helps you
handle the environment settings when these community tools are used.
