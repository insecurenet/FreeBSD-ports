ExaDDOS is an application able to gather different data sources to present a
real time unified view of your network.

It can gather:
* SNMP information at your edge
* IPFIX export from your routers

And present it using a web interface. Our goal is to very quickly integrate
it with ExaBGP to allow a "one click" anti-DDOS solution.
