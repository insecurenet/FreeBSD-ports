UPnP media server

MediaTomb is an open source (GPL) UPnP MediaServer with a nice web
user interface, it allows you to stream your digital media through
your home network and listen to/watch it on a variety of UPnP
compatible devices.

MediaTomb implements the UPnP MediaServer V 1.0 specification that can
be found on http://www.upnp.org/. The current implementation focuses
on parts that are required by the specification, however we look into
extending the functionality to cover the optional parts of the spec as
well.
