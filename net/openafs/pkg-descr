AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon
University and supported and developed as a product by Transarc Corporation
(now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server architecture for
federated file sharing and replicated read-only content distribution,
providing location independence, scalability, security, and transparent
migration capabilities. AFS is available for a broad range of heterogeneous
systems including UNIX, Linux, MacOS X, and Microsoft Windows.

IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the
release OpenAFS.
