IOG is a network I/O byte grapher made to graph cumulative KB/MB/GB
totals for hours/days and months. It is intended to be simple, fast
(support thousands of hosts) and integrate well with MRTG. Data for
each host is updated hourly and HTML graphs are created. It uses a
data consolidation algorithm which allows for a small, non-growing
database file for each host. No external graphing libs or
executables are required.

IOG has been used in several production ISP environments,
including at the authors company, Dynamic Internet (dyni.net).
