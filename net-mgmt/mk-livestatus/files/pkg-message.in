Notes:

 * See the documentation at http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html

 * Requires that net-mgmt/nagios be built with WITH_EVENT_BROKER=yes or
   livestatus.o will never be loaded...

 * unixcat (for use with reading from the socket and/or inetd(8) support)
   moved from %%PREFIX%%/bin
   to %%PREFIX%%/lib/mk-livestatus
   in order to avoid a conflict with sysutils/ucspi-unix

 * livecheck was removed in 1.2.3.i5,
   Please adjust your "broker_module=..." directive in etc/nagios/nagios.cfg!
