Skylable Sx is a reliable, fully distributed cluster solution for your data
storage needs. With Sx you can aggregate the disk space available on multiple
servers and merge it into a single storage system. The cluster makes sure that
your data is always replicated over multiple nodes (the exact number of copies
is defined by the sysadmin) and synchronized. Additionally Sx has built-in
support for deduplication, client-side encryption, on-the-fly compression and
much more.
