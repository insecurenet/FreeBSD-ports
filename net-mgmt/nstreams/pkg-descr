Nstreams is a program which analyzes the streams that occur on a network. It
displays which streams are generated by the users between several networks,
and between the networks and the outside. It can optionally generate the
ipchains or ipfw rules that will match these streams, thus only allowing what
is required for the users, and nothing more.

Nstreams can parse the tcpdump output, or the files generated with the -w
option of tcpdump. It can also directly sniff the data that occurs on the
network.
