SEND is the implementation of RFC3971 Secure Neighbor Discovery
(SEND). SEND cryptographically secures the IPv6 neighbor discovery
protocol, countering the threats discussed in RFC3756 (IPv6 Neighbor
Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats).

The implementation is a new version of DoCoMo's SEND (send_0.2) that
was implemented completely in user space. Novelty in send_0.3 is the
native SEND API that avoids the need for the use of netgraph and BPF,
which makes send_0.3 portable over different BSD platforms and
significantlly more efficient.

Also included in the distribution are implementations of RFC3972
Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) and RFC3779 X.509
Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers.
