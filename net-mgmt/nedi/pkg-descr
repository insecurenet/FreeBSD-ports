NeDi is a lightweight network management framework, which is based on a
scheduled discovery, an SQL backend, and a web-based user interface.  It
sucks information through SNMP or CLI from your switches and routers and
stores information (such as MACs and IPs) in a MySQL database.

Later, you can use its web interface to easily locate nodes withing your
network.
