This module supports the ability to retrieve data from several
different models of TL1 devices.  Explictly supported devices
include the following:

* Cisco ONS15327
* Cisco ONS15454
* Cisco ONS15808
* Nortel OME 6500
* Nortel HDXc
* Ciena CoreDirector
* Infinera DTC
* Fujitsu FLASHWAVE 7500

Each specifically supported device has its own
GRNOC::TL1::Device module, which sets the default port and
prompt used for that device.  They also may each export their
own unique commands on top of what is already provided in
GRNOC::TL1::Device.  Raw commands and output can be sent and
received, or output can be parsed via the parse function, or
by calling a function for that device.
