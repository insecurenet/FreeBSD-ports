A Zabbix proxy can collect performance and availability data on behalf of the
Zabbix server. This way, a proxy can take on itself some of the load of
collecting data and offload the Zabbix server.

Also, using a proxy is the easiest way of implementing centralized and
distributed monitoring, when all agents and proxies report to one Zabbix server
and all data is collected centrally.

Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution.
