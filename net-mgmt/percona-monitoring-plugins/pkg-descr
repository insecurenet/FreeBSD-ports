The Percona Monitoring Plugins are high-quality components to add
enterprise-grade MySQL capabilities to your existing in-house, on-premises
monitoring solutions. The components are designed to integrate seamlessly with
widely deployed solutions such as Nagios and Cacti, and are delivered in the
form of templates, plugins, and scripts.

The project was also known as mysql-cacti-templates and better-cacti-templates.
