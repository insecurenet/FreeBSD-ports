BandwidthD tracks usage of TCP/IP network subnets and builds html files with
graphs to display utilization.<br/>

Charts are built by individual IPs, and by default display utilization over 2
day, 8 day, 40 day, and 400 day periods. Furthermore, each IP address's
utilization can be logged out in CDF format, or to a backend database
server.<br/>

HTTP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, VPN, and P2P traffic are color coded.
