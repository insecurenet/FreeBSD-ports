		<descr><![CDATA[Softflowd is flow-based network traffic analyser capable of Cisco NetFlow data export.&lt;br/&gt;
			Softflowd semi-statefully tracks traffic flows recorded by listening on a network interface or by reading a packet capture file. These flows may be reported via NetFlow to a collecting host or summarised within softflowd itself.&lt;br/&gt;
			Softflowd supports Netflow versions 1, 5, 9 and 10 (IPFIX) and is fully IPv6-capable - it can track IPv6 flows and send export datagrams via IPv6. It also supports export to multicast groups, allowing for redundant flow collectors.&lt;br/&gt;]]></descr>
