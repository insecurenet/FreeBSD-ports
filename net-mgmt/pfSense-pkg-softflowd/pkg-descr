Softflowd is flow-based network traffic analyser capable of Cisco NetFlow data
export.<br/>
Softflowd semi-statefully tracks traffic flows recorded
by listening on a network interface or by reading a
packet capture file. These flows may be reported via
NetFlow to a collecting host or summarised within
softflowd itself.<br/> Softflowd supports Netflow
versions 1, 5, 9 and 10 (IPFIX) and is fully IPv6-capable - it can
track IPv6 flows and send export datagrams via IPv6. It
also supports export to multicast groups, allowing for
redundant flow collectors.
