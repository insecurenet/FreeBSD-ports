Papi, the Python Accessibility Programming Interface, is a Python
wrapper around the GNOME ATK toolkit.
It allows a developer to make python objects and applications
easily accessibility aware without the need to install PyGTK and
the GNOME accessibility components. Instead it only depends on ATK
and - on the developers behalf - the ATK/AT-SPI bridge shipped with
AT-SPI.
