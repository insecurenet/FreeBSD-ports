I could not find a client with the features I was looking for, so yes,
here is yet another IRC client.  Here's what makes it different from
others:

   * absolutely NO scripting ability.
   * termcap based (e.g. fast!).
   * emacs-style key bindings
   * full ircd 2.9+ support.
   * virtual windows a la screen(1).
   * multi server support.
   * non blocking TCP connections.
   * basic support for multi-homed systems.
   * everything goes and stays in the lastlog.
   * convenient scrolling (with searching abilities) in the lastlog.
   * 10 display filters! (2 ignore features are based on this).
   * highly customizable. (format strings, filters..)
   * customization possible at every level (channel, window, server..).
   * non blocking DNS lookups (A and PTR records).
   * "tabkey" style completion for /msg, /squery and public discussion.
   * DCC support.
   * CTCP support.
