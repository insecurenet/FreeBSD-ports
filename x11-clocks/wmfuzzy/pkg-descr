wmfuzzy is a fuzzy clock Windowmaker dock applet (but also runs well
under *boxen and many other windowmanagers).

A fuzzy clock gives an approximate time, under the supposition that
it's more useful to know that it's about Half Past Three than that
it's 3:27.  The granularity of the approximation can be set via
commandline switches.
