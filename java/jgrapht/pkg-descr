JGraphT is a free Java graph library that provides mathematical graph-theory
objects and algorithms. JGraphT supports various types of graphs including:
    * directed and undirected graphs.
    * graphs with weighted / unweighted / labeled or any user-defined edges.
    * various edge multiplicity options, including: simple-graphs, multigraphs,
      pseudographs.
    * unmodifiable graphs - allow modules to provide "read-only" access to
      internal graphs.
    * listenable graphs - allow external listeners to track modification events.
    * subgraphs graphs that are auto-updating subgraph views on other graphs.
    * all compositions of above graphs.

Although powerful, JGraphT is designed to be simple. For example, graph vertices
can be of any objects. You can create graphs based on: Strings, URLs, XML
documents, etc; you can even create graphs of graphs!
