This is the Java based Constructor of Useful Parsers (CUP for short).  It
serves the same role as the widely used program YAXX and in fact offers most
of the features of YACC.  However,  CUP is written in Java, uses specifications
including embedded Java code, and produces parsers which are implemented in
Java.
