	ATTENTION:

- If you want to know how to use mldonkey, read "INSTALL" or
  "FAQ.html" in the port docs (%%DOCSDIR%%)

- It is not a bad idea to install mplayer. You will be able
  to preview half-downloaded files (if you have the beginning).

- You can import the downloads you started with eDonkey
  (try "import /home/directory/path/.edonkey2000-core"
  on the console), but you can NOT go back!

- If this is the first time you install mldonkey,
  please go to the mldonkey-gui ports dir as a user and enter:

     make install-user

  this will set up your user config.

- You have to enable the different protocols on the client
  console. Go to the (mldonkey-) console, and try the commands
  'set enable_<protocol> true' (try 'voo' for reference).
