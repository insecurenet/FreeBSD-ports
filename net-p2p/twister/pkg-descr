twister is an experimental decentralized P2P microblogging platform leveraging
from the free software implementations of Bitcoin and BitTorrent protocols.

User registration and authentication is provided by a bitcoin-like network, so
it is completely distributed (does not depend on any central authority).

Post distribution uses kademlia DHT network and bittorrent-like swarms, both are
provided by libtorrent.

Both Bitcoin and libtorrent versions included here are highly patched and do not
interoperate with existing networks (on purpose).

Warning!  This is alpha software! In other words: this software is probably
difficult to compile, it is not feature-complete, it can be unstable, and it may
crash causing data loss. You have been warned.

If you choose to continue you probably must fall into one of the following
categories:

    You are a developer.
    You are an early adopter (who wants to reserve your nickname).
    You are a masochist.
